<p>August 28, 1912 â€“ March 30, 2006</p>

<p>Notes by</p>

<p>Her Children, Grandchildren and Sister</p>

<p>Ruth was born in Kansas City, Missouri, the eldest of four sisters, the daughter of James F. Goodman and Eloise Cameron Osborne. For generations her fatherâ€™s family had been in the lumber business, following the forests from Pennsylvania to Wisconsin. Her sisters are Mary Goodman Geyer and Margo Decker and Elizabeth Jones. The Goodman sisters attended Christian Science Sunday School and Sunset Hill School in Kansas City. Ruth graduated in a class of twelve, many of whom stayed in touch throughout their lives. She began college at Antioch College, transferring to Vassar College when her sister Mary started there. Ruth majored in economics and languages. Ruth and Mary traveled together in the summers while in college, taking classes in Moscow, Paris and Geneva.</p>

<p>Ruth met her husband, Donald Vernam Dobbins, while they were working at the Department of Agriculture in Washington, DC where Donâ€™s father, D. C. Dobbins, was a member of Congress. After they married on March 2nd, 1936, they honeymooned in Hot Springs, Arkansas, on their way to Donâ€™s new job with the Resettlement Administration in Amarillo, Texas. From there they came back to Champaign where Don completed law school at the U of I, joined his father in practice at Dobbins &amp; Dobbins and started their family&#8211; Elinor, twins Cam and Jim, and Charlie (and the loyal family dog, Mike). For 25 years the family lived at 110 North Prospect in Champaign. Interwoven threads that ran all through Ruthâ€™s life were education, family, adventure, service and independence. She believed in life long learning for everyone.</p>

<p>Community service in the old-fashioned sense of the term saw Ruth as a Cub Scout Den Mother, a long time volunteer at the Champaign Library and first and foremost an advocate for family planning. In 1940 she was one of the founders of the Champaign County Family Planning Center, now Planned Parenthood of East Central Illinois, which today serves 36 counties. She volunteered there in a wide variety of capacities and was proud to still be working into her 90â€™s. Even after she became legally blind, she served as a file clerk, culling files and becoming a master shredder. In recognition of her contributions, PPEIC established the annual Ruth Dobbins Award for outstanding volunteer service.</p>

<p>Ruth was fierce about her independence, but when she decided it was time to give something up, she did it and moved on. Her adjustment to the significant challenges of widowhood and blindness were inspiring. After Don died in 1981 she kept their boat, the Anhinga, a 43â€™ Gulfstar trawler, in Indiantown, Florida and continued to live aboard each winter for another 15 yearsâ€”the barefoot part of her life. She was active in the Indiantown Yacht Club and helped set up a little â€œtwigâ€ library (a branch of a branch) at the Indiantown Marina. She joined the YMCA for a variety of exercise classes and walked every day. For 35 years she lived at Park Place Condominium in Champaign where she made many friends and enjoyed long walks in West Side Park and to Carmonâ€™s, the library, the post office and the downtown Champaign.</p>

<p>Ruth thrived on adventures small and large. She filled the family station wagon with her children and their friends for trips to every U of I barn and to the lakes of Kickapoo. During summers she drove four children under twelve, supplies and orange crates of books up north to â€œSeaBeeHiveâ€ at Basset Lake, Minnesotaâ€”a three-room log cabin with propane stove and refrigerator, a little red hand pump at the sink and an outhouse out back. Exposed to this unfettered life, her children thrived. Nightly entertainment was Ruthâ€™s reading of the classics which instilled in the children a voracious appetite for reading. It is a marvel that she coped with four highly active children from Memorial Day to Labor Day a half mile from the nearest road without electricity and Donâ€¦who flew North in his Gruman SeaBee amphibious plane every other weekend. Twice Ruth and Don loaded gear, two boats, a canoe and all the children into the station wagon to camp out on Canadian wilderness lakes. After the children left home, Don and Ruth twice captained their own boats down the Mississippi River into the Gulf of Mexico. They explored the Mayan ruins of Mexico and Central America and fished Central and South America, Canada and Alaska. Together Ruth and Don conceived and established the pioneering sport fishing camp, ClÃºb de Pesca de Casa Mar, in the remote jungles of the Rio Colorado in Costa Rica. After Donâ€™s death, Ruth continued to travel as far north as Iceland and as far south as the Amazon .</p>

<p>Ruth has four grandsons: Seth Dobbins, AC Capehart, David Dobbins and Scott Dobbins. When each of them turned thirteen, she exposed them to the grandeur of the West on camping trips and rafting expeditions. At 92 she sat in the bottom of a canoe for a four hour float trip on the Current River in Missouri. At the time of her death, Ruth was planning to take her hiking boots to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan this summer. She always liked to have at least one trip on the drawing board.</p>

<p>She truly lived a full life.</p>

<p>Private interment will take place at the Forrest Home Cemetery in Marinette, Wisconsin.</p>

Even though I&rsquo;ve taken some good precautions on the host, I&rsquo;ve failed to keep wordpress up-to-date. This has allowed script-kiddies and others with more time than quality of life to repurpose it. No longer!
With Hugo, I do site generation localy and upload static HTML. What does this mean for you? Faster page loads, and content that I actually produced.</div>

We weren&#8217;t really sure what we wanted to do today, but we had talked about doing one of the &#8220;bus to bus&#8221; walks in Brighton where you could take a bus to one of the stops and then do a country walk in the Sussex downs to somewhere else that a bus runs, and catch that back into town. As a family, we&#8217;d done the Ditchling Beacon to Devil&#8217;s Dyke walk once.</div>

Yogurt and blueberries for myself while Sam and Carolyn had Muffins with Bonne Mammon, clementines and milk. We confirmed that trains to Lewes were frequent and headed up to the station. We got our tickets there and boarded a Southern &#8220;local&#8221; train with a few stops before we even got to Lewes.</div>

I wish I were more observant about the mundane, because in some important ways, I think it&#8217;s the mudane that matters far more than the extrordinary. At least in story telling.
We left Philadelphia Thursday evening. We flew from the international terminal at PHL on USAirways. We were originally supposed to fly from A6 at one end of the terminal, and shortly after we settled down there, an announcement came over the PA that there was a gate change and we needed to switch to A23 at the other end of the terminal.</div>

I came across this posting on the python group I&#8217;m a member of on (in?) Linked In.
The first typo, was a bit awkward, but I could see how it would happen during an editing/revision session when that session wasn&#8217;t followed by a proofreading. &#8220;Our client is a leader in the worldwide leader&#8221;. So, what you&#8217;re saying is they lead?
But what actually cracked me up was the simple substitution of a &#8220;t&#8221; where a &#8220;d&#8221; should go.</div>

Instead, they followed me from place to place still in the boxes we packed back then.

I was invited to a &#8220;buy nothing&#8221; day on Facebook. I suppose if the point is to raise awareness of needless consumerism, I&#8217;m a fan. But in this era of anti-capitalism, of the &#8220;99%&#8221;, I&#8217;m wary.</div>

I&#8217;m listening to my &#8220;Everything but the Girl&#8221; radio station on Pandora. As Carolyn put it, &#8220;Is it nothing but Everything But the Girl&#8221;? Pleasant enough in itself, but thanks to Lexus, I&#8217;m enjoying it as part of a free trial to Pandora One. It&#8217;s funny how it&#8217;s the little things.
