</div>

<p>I started this after having played wallyball with Mike &#8212; they don&#8217;t play in the summer, and there had been a little bit of buzz about it. Someone else started it up, but quickly stopped coming, and I gladly took over. I set up a mailing list and sent weekly <strike>harassment</strike> reminder emails. At our best, we got up to 5-v-5 which got to be some real fun.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re now in our second &#8220;season&#8221; and this is one more thing that I&#8217;m going to miss about the upcoming move. I warned people in my last harassment email that this past Sunday was likely the last game that I&#8217;d be able to make. I was hoping that this would mean a bunch of people who don&#8217;t come regularly would make the effort to do so. One did, which brought our total up to 5 players. Oh well.</p>

<p>Still, I was incredibly touched as this Sunday, Mike and Juan hung a HUGE sign that said &#8220;Congratulations!&#8221; and &#8220;Carolyn &amp; AC, We&#8217;ll Miss You!&#8221; They also presented me with the trophy on the left. The caption on the image is what the trophy says. I have as much claim to being &#8220;Altoona Soccer Champion&#8221; as I have to being president of the moon &#8212; which is to say, it&#8217;s possible, but not terribly likely! I teared up a little, as did Carolyn when I told her this story. At the end of the game, I gave my soccer ball, and the cones I&#8217;d been bringing to Juan so that he could carry on the tradition. I&#8217;m going to stay on the mailing list so that I can watch the activity at least!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll reiterate what amazing people we&#8217;ve found in Altoona. I think it&#8217;s one of the strengths of a small community in a small town. I keep coming back to Robert Axelrod&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=choicywhitebo-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0465021212%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1148353193%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1%3F%255Fencoding%3DUTF8">The Evolution of Cooperation</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=choicywhitebo-20&l=ur2&o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />&#8221; &#8212; the relevant bit of which is basically that the more often you are going to have to interact with someone in the future, the more it pays to be nice to them<footnote>Actually, the recommendation is to start &#8220;nice&#8221; and use the &#8220;tit-for-tat&#8221; strategy. My little summary here is both incomplete and inaccurate, but suffices to make my point. I recommend actually reading the book, it&#8217;s a surprisingly adept application of game theory to a number of apparently different situations from biology to sociology to political science.</footnote>.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether it comes about from small-town-ism, or just good fortune, I&#8217;m happy to have drawn such nice and considerate people into my life, and sorry to be letting them go. Carolyn and I each experienced sadness from this tale, but with very different flavors. My sadness was painted with appreciation for the love shown to us even in our departure. Carolyn&#8217;s was colored with the guilt of leaving these great people behind. Though we&#8217;ll each do it in our own way, we&#8217;re both going to miss people here a great deal.</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">I&rsquo;ve started using Hugo for site generation for my blog. Too long, I&rsquo;ve let it go to the weeds. Even though I&rsquo;ve taken some good precautions on the host, I&rsquo;ve failed to keep wordpress up-to-date. This has allowed script-kiddies and others with more time than quality of life to repurpose it. No longer!
With Hugo, I do site generation localy and upload static HTML. What does this mean for you? Faster page loads, and content that I actually produced.</div>

We weren&#8217;t really sure what we wanted to do today, but we had talked about doing one of the &#8220;bus to bus&#8221; walks in Brighton where you could take a bus to one of the stops and then do a country walk in the Sussex downs to somewhere else that a bus runs, and catch that back into town. As a family, we&#8217;d done the Ditchling Beacon to Devil&#8217;s Dyke walk once.</div>

Yogurt and blueberries for myself while Sam and Carolyn had Muffins with Bonne Mammon, clementines and milk. We confirmed that trains to Lewes were frequent and headed up to the station. We got our tickets there and boarded a Southern &#8220;local&#8221; train with a few stops before we even got to Lewes.</div>

I wish I were more observant about the mundane, because in some important ways, I think it&#8217;s the mudane that matters far more than the extrordinary. At least in story telling.
We left Philadelphia Thursday evening. We flew from the international terminal at PHL on USAirways. We were originally supposed to fly from A6 at one end of the terminal, and shortly after we settled down there, an announcement came over the PA that there was a gate change and we needed to switch to A23 at the other end of the terminal.</div>

I came across this posting on the python group I&#8217;m a member of on (in?) Linked In.
The first typo, was a bit awkward, but I could see how it would happen during an editing/revision session when that session wasn&#8217;t followed by a proofreading. &#8220;Our client is a leader in the worldwide leader&#8221;. So, what you&#8217;re saying is they lead?
But what actually cracked me up was the simple substitution of a &#8220;t&#8221; where a &#8220;d&#8221; should go.</div>

I still remember packing up his model trains with my dad and some of the rest of the family. The specific bit of his legacy for me. They hadn&#8217;t been unpacked since. Instead, they followed me from place to place still in the boxes we packed back then. For the past several years, they were stored with the inlaws who recently kindly suggested that maybe it was time for them to come home.</div>

It&#8217;s a handful, and like any good job, understaffed. But it&#8217;s going to be fun. And I&#8217;m going to learn lots. I&#8217;m quite excited by the undertaking.

However, I&#8217;m also not part of some ideological movement in opposition to shopping today. I just don&#8217;t like crowds. I can&#8217;t be bothered.
I was invited to a &#8220;buy nothing&#8221; day on Facebook. I suppose if the point is to raise awareness of needless consumerism, I&#8217;m a fan. But in this era of anti-capitalism, of the &#8220;99%&#8221;, I&#8217;m wary.</div>

I&#8217;m listening to my &#8220;Everything but the Girl&#8221; radio station on Pandora. As Carolyn put it, &#8220;Is it nothing but Everything But the Girl&#8221;? Pleasant enough in itself, but thanks to Lexus, I&#8217;m enjoying it as part of a free trial to Pandora One. It&#8217;s funny how it&#8217;s the little things. For no particular reason that I can think of, BMW has always been the target of my automotive lust.</div>
