<p>Dear Sam,</p>

<p>Do you hear that noise? Thatâ€™s your parents laughing and crying and jumping up and down because you turned ONE YEAR old, which means we MADE IT! We survived the first year, and here you are laughing, smiling, talking, and nearly walking. One full orbit around the sun and our newborn blob has become a little person with opinions and personality. Dad and I feel like we can finally breathe after 365 days of worry.</p>

<p>Now do you hear THAT sound? Thatâ€™s the sound of the universe laughing at us. It turns out that the worrying does not go away. No! It becomes more intense. But fortunately the love and pride we feel for you, and the joy you bring us, also intensifies. Your 12th month has been a lot of fun, culminating in a wonderful and moving birthday celebration. So what was the final month of your first year of life like?</p>

<p>Incredible. Sam, this past month I have exclaimed to you, to your father, to anyone, that you are SO SMART. Itâ€™s true. You blow me away. Now I know that every parent probably thinks that her kid is smart, and that may well be, but that doesnâ€™t change the fact that we think you are brilliant. Some examples:</p>

<p>â€¢ You and I were reading a book that mentions a lightning bug. When you heard me say â€œlightning bug,â€ you pointed up to the ceiling light. This is because we often ask you â€œWhereâ€™s the light?â€ and you point to the lights in the ceiling. You can also identify feet, ears, and noses, though when we ask â€œWhereâ€™s your nose?â€ you usually point to our noses. Thatâ€™s ok. Our noses are pretty prominent.</p>

  <p class="caption">

</div>

<p>â€¢ While I feed you lunch out back in the garden, you identify various sights and sounds: a dog barks and you say â€œGoâ€ (we think you picked that up from one of your favorite books, <em>Go, Dog, Go!</em>). A bird chirps and you say â€œBir.â€ Camus comes flapping through the cat door and you point and say â€œGackâ€ or increasingly â€œGat.â€ One afternoon, though, I thought you had lost your little 11-month old marbles: you kept pointing to the tree behind me and saying â€œGo, go!â€ I shook my head sadly. â€œI donâ€™t think there are any dogs in the tree, honey.â€ You insisted, however, and so I turned to look. Two squirrels were cavorting in the branches. Of course. Tree dogs! At the end of <em>Go, Dog, Go!</em> all the dogs are partying on the top of a tree. So for you, this was a case of life imitating art.</p>

<p>â€¢ You already seem to have developed an internalized superego. We spent a lot of time at the neighborhood park this past month, and after several instances of hearing me say â€œnoâ€ whenever you brought a twig or a leaf or a wood chip to your mouth, you caught on. Now I watch in amazement as you pick up some forbidden object, advance it towards your lips, then say â€œNo, noâ€ and put it down. Is that great or what?</p>

<h3 id="talk-talk-you-like-to-talk">Talk, Talk, You Like to Talk</h3>

<p>As you can see, youâ€™ve been focusing on language acquisition. Youâ€™ve expanded and refined some of your vocabulary. Towards the end of the month, â€œGoâ€ became â€œGawâ€ as you work on the vowel for â€œdogâ€ (or as Daddy says â€œDawgâ€). â€œBallâ€ is â€œBaw.â€ â€œBookâ€ is â€œBuhâ€ and your beloved Emma Bear is â€œBeeâ€ or â€œBea.â€ Youâ€™re also working on intonation, and you know that when you ask for something, your voice should rise at the end. So when you bring us a book to read itâ€™s â€œBuh?â€ and â€œMo?â€ when you want more of something.</p>

<p>And youâ€™re doing ASL signs to go along with some of these! We started teaching you sign language when you turned 7 months old. Just some basics: â€œmilk,â€ â€œeat,â€ â€œmore,â€ â€œcat,â€ â€œmommy,â€ and â€œdaddyâ€ (ok, so those words pretty much cover your whole universe). Anyway, out of the blue this month, you signed for â€œmilk,â€ â€œeat,â€ and â€œmoreâ€! I nearly fell over trying to reward you with whatever you had asked for. You are especially cute when you ask for milk, because you do the sign with both hands. Sometimes you mix up â€œeatâ€ and â€œmore.â€ And sometimes we canâ€™t figure out what you want more of&#8230; which results in the crystal clear, universal baby sign of throwing a fit. Unfortunately, even though you speak and sign several words, we still suffer from miscommunication. Go figure. But I shouldnâ€™t complain. When I took you to your first â€œTot Lotâ€ in Albany and you rode the swing for the first time, you giggled like a mad baby and signed â€œmore,â€ â€œmoreâ€ over and over again. All the other parents and nannies probably wondered why I had tears in my eyes and why I wouldnâ€™t surrender the swing.</p>

<h3 id="walk-walk-youâ-re-getting-ready-to-walk">Walk, Walk, Youâ€™re Getting Ready to Walk</h3>

<p>In addition to the parks in the East Bay, weâ€™re also checking out ones in San Francisco. Early in your 12th month we met Daddy for lunch one day at his office. We went to a nearby park and sat in the grass and ate take-out Thai food. After Daddy went back to work, however, you would not sit still. You crawled right over to the concrete steps in the middle of the park and proceeded to climb them. I hovered, all protective and worried, because, you know, you had never climbed steps before, and this was a public park and there were all sorts of people using those steps to go about their business. But climbing those steps was your business, baby, and you would not be deterred. You even climbed down one step, to my amazement. You would have stayed there all afternoon, I think, going up and down, but I pulled you away amidst your protests, so we could catch BART back home before rush hour.</p>

<p>While you are now an expert crawler and climber, we are still watching for those first unassisted steps. You started cruising this month (it is less risquÃ© than it sounds), by which I mean, you pull up on furniture and use it as an anchor as you shuffle your feet along. You love to pull up on stuff (including our pant legs) and you would do everything standing if you could. One of your favorite activities is to pull up on the wooden chest in your room and rifle through your book collection. You adore books now, and you ask us to read the same ones over and over. Just like your Mama who, when she likes a CD, will put it on repeat-mode, you like your books on repeat-mode. For a long time it was Dr. Seussâ€™s <em>Hop on Pop</em>. I will likely be able to recite that book until I die. It got so bad that I was driving your Dad nuts because I was quoting it all the time. There were also days (after some rough nights with you) when I felt envious of one of the characters, â€œRed,â€ who is pictured all cozily tucked in bed. And I could go on at length about the Lacanian overtones in the actual â€œHop on Popâ€ sequence, but Iâ€™ll spare you until youâ€™re older. All of this to sayâ€¦ weâ€™ve read that book a lot.</p>

<p>But not without a peep. Sometimes two. But more often than not you make it through the whole night in your crib without crying for us to come to you. We did have a string of bad nights just before your birthday. Lo and behold one morning Daddy noticed that you had sprouted more teeth. Three on the top popped all at once. A second bottom tooth had been slowly erupting all month long, and so now you have five teeth. They help you gnaw on more interesting foods (buttered toast fingers, Kashi cheerios, even broccoli) but you still havenâ€™t figured out that the purpose of teeth is to mash food up so you can swallow it more easily. Food is still a toy, and meals are something that happen to you while youâ€™re playing. This means that in general you are really good in restaurants, because thereâ€™s so much for you to taste and watch. You even behaved pretty well at our dear friend <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/ras39/">Rebecca</a>â€™s presentation at the <a href="http://velvetdavinci.com/">Velvet DaVinci gallery</a> in Russian Hill. She graciously invited us all, and did not mind your chatter during her talk. It pleased me that Rebecca got to see you just before you turned one year old because she first met you when you were only a couple of weeks old. So like us, she can appreciate how much youâ€™ve grown.</p>

<p>Also shortly before your birthday, we suffered a scary, pre-bedtime incident with you. Daddy usually gets you out of your clothes and diaper to bring you to the bath. While you were lying on the changing pad, he was giving you belly farts, which you LOVE. But sadly, your giggles turned to screams because as Daddy leaned down to your belly, you kicked your legs up at his chest and your left leg hyper-extended and then gave under the weight of his chest. Your new pediatrician said there was no damage, however, and she was right, because within a week you were back to standing as usual. Still, it freaked us out. I guess this is just the beginning of such scares as you become a toddler. Please go easy, on us, ok? Ah, thereâ€™s that sound again. Oh well. If you can learn to talk, sign, stand, climb, feed yourself, turn the pages of a book, and chase after Camus in one year, I suppose your parents can learn to relax into parenthoodâ€¦ maybe.</p>

<p>So on your first birthday, darling Samantha, we celebrate your amazing little life. Hereâ€™s to much talking, walking, and sleeping in the second year. We canâ€™t wait.</p>

<p>Love,</p>

<p>Mama and Daddy</p>

Even though I&rsquo;ve taken some good precautions on the host, I&rsquo;ve failed to keep wordpress up-to-date. This has allowed script-kiddies and others with more time than quality of life to repurpose it. No longer!
With Hugo, I do site generation localy and upload static HTML. What does this mean for you? Faster page loads, and content that I actually produced.</div>

We weren&#8217;t really sure what we wanted to do today, but we had talked about doing one of the &#8220;bus to bus&#8221; walks in Brighton where you could take a bus to one of the stops and then do a country walk in the Sussex downs to somewhere else that a bus runs, and catch that back into town. As a family, we&#8217;d done the Ditchling Beacon to Devil&#8217;s Dyke walk once.</div>

I wish I were more observant about the mundane, because in some important ways, I think it&#8217;s the mudane that matters far more than the extrordinary. At least in story telling.
We left Philadelphia Thursday evening. We flew from the international terminal at PHL on USAirways. We were originally supposed to fly from A6 at one end of the terminal, and shortly after we settled down there, an announcement came over the PA that there was a gate change and we needed to switch to A23 at the other end of the terminal.</div>

I came across this posting on the python group I&#8217;m a member of on (in?) Linked In.
The first typo, was a bit awkward, but I could see how it would happen during an editing/revision session when that session wasn&#8217;t followed by a proofreading. &#8220;Our client is a leader in the worldwide leader&#8221;. So, what you&#8217;re saying is they lead?
But what actually cracked me up was the simple substitution of a &#8220;t&#8221; where a &#8220;d&#8221; should go.</div>

I was invited to a &#8220;buy nothing&#8221; day on Facebook. I suppose if the point is to raise awareness of needless consumerism, I&#8217;m a fan. But in this era of anti-capitalism, of the &#8220;99%&#8221;, I&#8217;m wary.</div>

I&#8217;m listening to my &#8220;Everything but the Girl&#8221; radio station on Pandora. As Carolyn put it, &#8220;Is it nothing but Everything But the Girl&#8221;? Pleasant enough in itself, but thanks to Lexus, I&#8217;m enjoying it as part of a free trial to Pandora One. It&#8217;s funny how it&#8217;s the little things.
