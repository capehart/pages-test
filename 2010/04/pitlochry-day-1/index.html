    Train
  </p>
</div>

<p>Saturday we took a train to London&#8217;s Victoria station. Then we took a tube from there to King&#8217;s Cross station. From there, we took a train to Edinburgh. From there, we took another train to Pitlochry. On the long-haul train from London to Edinburgh, we were fortunate in that we had reserved seats at a table and the reserved seats across from us were unoccupied, as we only needed 2 tickets, because Sam is an &#8220;under 5&#8221; but that meant we only got 2 seats. We arrived without event except that I&#8217;m pretty sure I left my hat on the London to Edinburgh train which is terribly disappointing. I guess another trip to <a href="http://www.goorin.com/">Goorin Brothers</a> is in order next time I&#8217;m back in SF. It was always a bit too small, but I&#8217;m still disappointed to have left it behind.</p>

<p>Once here in Pitlochry, we made our way to <a href="http://www.craigroyston.co.uk/">Craigroyston House (&amp;lodge!)</a> where we&#8217;re staying in the &#8220;self-catering cottage.&#8221; It&#8217;s a cute little place. The downstairs is a kitchen/dining room on one side and a living room on the other side. The stairs in the center t-off into two small bedrooms, each with its own tiny shower-room. A powder-room is tucked into one of the crevices of the T.</p>

<p>After being shown around the cottage, we went out to <a href="http://www.co-operative.coop/">the co-op</a> to pick up stuff for Sunday&#8217;s breakfast. Unfortunately, that made us late enough we missed entry to the restaurant we&#8217;d intended to go to. So we went to the next open one we found. It was fine. I had a &#8220;Mega-Burger&#8221;, Sam a Kid&#8217;s cheeseburger and Ca got Fish-n-Chips. Finally, we came home and all collapsed pretty readily.</p>

<p>Today (Sunday), I got up at 7 for a &#8220;<a href="http://go.nike.com/08hdoqk1">run</a>&#8221; &#8211; I&#8217;m still in the fairly early stages of a &#8220;<a href="http://www.felttip.com/c10k/">couch to 10k</a>&#8221; program. The run was inspiring. Running in the Scottish highlands was great. It was cool and overcast, but not cold enough to be unpleasant. My 5-ish mile run took me by a golf course, out of the little town and past some farmland, and even past 2 distilleries!</p>

<p>When I got back, Carolyn was up and writing, and it wasn&#8217;t long before Sam was up. We breakfasted and headed out to the town. We got Sam her first pair of actual hiking boots (which saw a real workout later in the day) and back to the co-op for some lunch food for the day. Back to the cottage for lunch, we then went for <a href="http://www.monsterfool.com/?p=731">a walk</a>. It was nice. I took lots pictures of the waterfall &#8220;Black Spout&#8221; and we traipsed past both of the distilleries that I&#8217;d run past earlier in the day. On the way back, we found a playground that Sam played in, a cat that Carolyn and Sam pet, and came back through the parking lot of a curling rink that doesn&#8217;t look exceptionally open any more.</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">I&rsquo;ve started using Hugo for site generation for my blog. Too long, I&rsquo;ve let it go to the weeds. Even though I&rsquo;ve taken some good precautions on the host, I&rsquo;ve failed to keep wordpress up-to-date. This has allowed script-kiddies and others with more time than quality of life to repurpose it. No longer!
With Hugo, I do site generation localy and upload static HTML. What does this mean for you? Faster page loads, and content that I actually produced.</div>

We weren&#8217;t really sure what we wanted to do today, but we had talked about doing one of the &#8220;bus to bus&#8221; walks in Brighton where you could take a bus to one of the stops and then do a country walk in the Sussex downs to somewhere else that a bus runs, and catch that back into town. As a family, we&#8217;d done the Ditchling Beacon to Devil&#8217;s Dyke walk once.</div>

Yogurt and blueberries for myself while Sam and Carolyn had Muffins with Bonne Mammon, clementines and milk. We confirmed that trains to Lewes were frequent and headed up to the station. We got our tickets there and boarded a Southern &#8220;local&#8221; train with a few stops before we even got to Lewes.</div>

I wish I were more observant about the mundane, because in some important ways, I think it&#8217;s the mudane that matters far more than the extrordinary. At least in story telling.
We left Philadelphia Thursday evening. We flew from the international terminal at PHL on USAirways. We were originally supposed to fly from A6 at one end of the terminal, and shortly after we settled down there, an announcement came over the PA that there was a gate change and we needed to switch to A23 at the other end of the terminal.</div>

I came across this posting on the python group I&#8217;m a member of on (in?) Linked In.
The first typo, was a bit awkward, but I could see how it would happen during an editing/revision session when that session wasn&#8217;t followed by a proofreading. &#8220;Our client is a leader in the worldwide leader&#8221;. So, what you&#8217;re saying is they lead?
But what actually cracked me up was the simple substitution of a &#8220;t&#8221; where a &#8220;d&#8221; should go.</div>

I still remember packing up his model trains with my dad and some of the rest of the family. The specific bit of his legacy for me. They hadn&#8217;t been unpacked since. Instead, they followed me from place to place still in the boxes we packed back then. For the past several years, they were stored with the inlaws who recently kindly suggested that maybe it was time for them to come home.</div>

It&#8217;s a handful, and like any good job, understaffed. But it&#8217;s going to be fun. And I&#8217;m going to learn lots. I&#8217;m quite excited by the undertaking.

However, I&#8217;m also not part of some ideological movement in opposition to shopping today. I just don&#8217;t like crowds. I can&#8217;t be bothered.
I was invited to a &#8220;buy nothing&#8221; day on Facebook. I suppose if the point is to raise awareness of needless consumerism, I&#8217;m a fan. But in this era of anti-capitalism, of the &#8220;99%&#8221;, I&#8217;m wary.</div>

I&#8217;m listening to my &#8220;Everything but the Girl&#8221; radio station on Pandora. As Carolyn put it, &#8220;Is it nothing but Everything But the Girl&#8221;? Pleasant enough in itself, but thanks to Lexus, I&#8217;m enjoying it as part of a free trial to Pandora One. It&#8217;s funny how it&#8217;s the little things. For no particular reason that I can think of, BMW has always been the target of my automotive lust.</div>
