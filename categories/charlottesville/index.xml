      <description>I started a new job last week. I&amp;#8217;m the VP Operations for Perrone Robotics. There are many things that I&amp;#8217;m responsible for. Internal IT and Network Infrastructure, Quality Assurance, Release Management and Customer Deployments. It&amp;#8217;s a handful, and like any good job, understaffed. But it&amp;#8217;s going to be fun. And I&amp;#8217;m going to learn lots. I&amp;#8217;m quite excited by the undertaking. Not to mention, it means we get to stay in Charlottesville a bit longer ðŸ™‚</description>

      <description>On the invitation of Sam&amp;#8217;s soccer football coach from West City Soccer with whom we play &amp;#8220;Family Futbol&amp;#8221;, I have joined a Co-Rec soccer league with SOCA. If I&amp;#8217;m not the oldest player on the team, I&amp;#8217;m pretty close. This team has a reserved field on Wednesdays for practice. We had our first practice last week, and there were maybe 6 or so team members who came out to practice. We did a little bit of practice on corner kicks, but it pretty quickly devolved into a small pick-up game.</description>
