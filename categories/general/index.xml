      <description>Saturday, we awoke late after a mixed night&amp;#8217;s sleep. We ate our breakfast procured from Waitrose the day before. Yogurt and blueberries for myself while Sam and Carolyn had Muffins with Bonne Mammon, clementines and milk. We confirmed that trains to Lewes were frequent and headed up to the station. We got our tickets there and boarded a Southern &amp;#8220;local&amp;#8221; train with a few stops before we even got to Lewes.</description>

      <description>Today ls &amp;#8220;black Friday.&amp;#8221; There are a lot of people out shopping today. I&amp;#8217;m not one of them.
However, I&amp;#8217;m also not part of some ideological movement in opposition to shopping today. I just don&amp;#8217;t like crowds. I can&amp;#8217;t be bothered.
I was invited to a &amp;#8220;buy nothing&amp;#8221; day on Facebook. I suppose if the point is to raise awareness of needless consumerism, I&amp;#8217;m a fan. But in this era of anti-capitalism, of the &amp;#8220;99%&amp;#8221;, I&amp;#8217;m wary.</description>

      <description>My mood has been low recently. But it&amp;#8217;s been lifted this morning by song.

I&amp;#8217;m listening to my &amp;#8220;Everything but the Girl&amp;#8221; radio station on Pandora. As Carolyn put it, &amp;#8220;Is it nothing but Everything But the Girl&amp;#8221;? Pleasant enough in itself, but thanks to Lexus, I&amp;#8217;m enjoying it as part of a free trial to Pandora One. It&amp;#8217;s funny how it&amp;#8217;s the little things. For no particular reason that I can think of, BMW has always been the target of my automotive lust.</description>

      <title>Steam Cracked</title>
      <link>https://blog.accapehart.com/2011/11/steam-cracked/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Nov 2011 04:26:16 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>choicywhiteboy@accapehart.com (AC Capehart)</author>
      <guid>https://blog.accapehart.com/2011/11/steam-cracked/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got a disturbing message on my Steam account, today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;intruders obtained access to a Steam database in addition to the forums. &lt;strong&gt;This database contained information including user names, hashed and salted passwords, game purchases, email addresses, billing addresses and encrypted credit card information&lt;/strong&gt;. We do not have evidence that encrypted credit card numbers or personally identifying information were taken by the intruders, or that the protection on credit card numbers or passwords was cracked. We are still investigating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(emphasis mine)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m unimpressed. Credit card data was in the same database as user data, purchase history, billing address, etc? To me, that means either: 1)They kept a whole bunch of information in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/&#34;&gt;PCI-DSS&lt;/a&gt; secured vault at great expense as getting data into and out of such a vault is difficult by design, or 2) They were storing credit card data outside of a PCI-DSS vault in direct violation of the guidelines set forth by Visa, MasterCard, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m also disturbed by the cagey language. &amp;#8220;We do not have evidence that &amp;#8230; credit card numbers &amp;#8230; were taken by the intruders.&amp;#8221; Given that it apparently took them 4 days from the forum defacement until the general announcement, I&amp;#8217;m insufficiently impressed with their reported forensics to think that their lack of evidence for some activity means an absence of that activity. Who knows how long they were in breach even before the forum defacement that caused them to stumble over the broader breach? I&amp;#8217;m also curious what algorithm was used for the credit card encryption. And where was the encryption key kept? Was it potentially exposed as well?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I&amp;#8217;m also sympathetic. When I was with Linden Lab, we suffered a database breach as well. We ended up forcing a change to everyone&amp;#8217;s passwords, pulling an all-nighter to implement new password recovery measures, manning the telephones to personally talk with affected customers and help them validate their accounts and change their passwords. Credit card data, however, was never exposed, nor at risk at the level of penetration the attacker reached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, I had a conversation with Valve nearly a year ago. I&amp;#8217;d heard they were looking for some international payment expertise and I got in touch. They ended up not thinking that I was what they needed, but at least I was able to put them in touch with the great people at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.envoyservices.com/&#34;&gt;Envoy&lt;/a&gt;. They apparently didn&amp;#8217;t connect either. I wish they&amp;#8217;d gotten someone in though, and that someone had taken a good, hard look at their credit card processing and storage. They&amp;#8217;d have been able to write a much less embarrassing letter. The full text of the note follows the break, but it ends with &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;I am truly sorry this happened, and I apologize for the inconvenience.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; I believe they&amp;#8217;re sorry it happened, but this is still such a milk toast apology. If I had to write that letter it would say something a little stronger, something like: &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#8217;m deeply disappointed that we failed to maintain the trust you put in us when you shared your personal information with us, and we&amp;#8217;re going to do everything we can to redouble our security efforts to ensure this sort of thing never happens again and to earn back your trust and loyalty as our most valued resource &amp;#8211; our customer.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meanwhile, if you have a Steam account, do yourself a favor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change your Steam password&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change your password anywhere else you used the Steam password (you know you did)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove your payment information from Steam until they can demonstrate they can be trusted with it
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

      <description>I had heard that Comcast&amp;#8217;s introduction into the area of some greater DOCSIS 3 infrastructure might have a positive impact on my available bandwidth. Sure enough, I&amp;#8217;m approaching 30 Mbs. Of course upload speeds aren&amp;#8217;t what they were last time I checked, but maybe that&amp;#8217;s a &amp;#8220;time of test&amp;#8221; issue.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;#8217;t believe it&amp;#8217;s been nearly a quarter since my last update. Certainly, I&amp;#8217;ve been keeping pretty busy. Singing Horse Studio is doing well, and starting to get as much work as we can handle. We now need to work on managing our growth. Another tricky area for a young business &amp;mdash; actually for ANY business. We&amp;#8217;ve expanded into the USA having successfully registered with the Virginia State Corporation Comission on July 1st, 2011.</description>

      <description>I had gone to do a little play dev work and discovered that my AWS machine was on a version of Ubuntu for which support had long-ago ended. I&amp;#8217;m setting up a new AWS host, but it&amp;#8217;s taking a little while to get everything sorted back out. So if my sites seem &amp;#8220;a bit off&amp;#8221; for the next couple of days, that&amp;#8217;s probably why. Like for some reason, the permalink structure of my wordpress instance doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to be working.</description>

      <description>I had a dream last night about a statue. That&amp;#8217;s all I remember about the dream &amp;#8211; the statue. The statue was titled &amp;#8220;The Many Muses of Flight&amp;#8221;
It was all white as if carved from white marble. It had a man in Dickensian garb complete with top hat leaping up, but he was only partially distinct from the white marble mass which was primarily shaped like the plumes of smoke from the early stages of a rocket launch.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was thinking recently of things I&amp;#8217;ve done, places I&amp;#8217;ve been. At forty, I still feel young. New to the world, even though my body isn&amp;#8217;t capable of what it once was. Looking back though, I&amp;#8217;m astonished and overwhelmed at the people and events that have found their way into my lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes at Thanksgiving, the holiday has just come and gone. Good food, good friends and family. This year, though I spent a little bit of time reflecting. I count myself genuinely lucky for the breadth of experiences I&amp;#8217;ve had, people I&amp;#8217;ve known, places I&amp;#8217;ve been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I just upgraded to the latest version of WordPress. I also deleted a lot of users. If one of them was you and your actually reading this, sorry. Best I could tell it was sleeper spam accounts. But basically, if your email address is in the .ru or .pl domains, and your &amp;#8220;real name&amp;#8221; doesn&amp;#8217;t match your email address at all, I figured you and I weren&amp;#8217;t on very close terms.</description>

      <description>OK, It&amp;#8217;s not day 1 anymore, but it feels that way.
Train  Saturday we took a train to London&amp;#8217;s Victoria station. Then we took a tube from there to King&amp;#8217;s Cross station. From there, we took a train to Edinburgh. From there, we took another train to Pitlochry. On the long-haul train from London to Edinburgh, we were fortunate in that we had reserved seats at a table and the reserved seats across from us were unoccupied, as we only needed 2 tickets, because Sam is an &amp;#8220;under 5&amp;#8221; but that meant we only got 2 seats.</description>

I&amp;#8217;ve been meaning to do this for a while. Capture some stories that I like on audio. This one&amp;#8217;s pretty good for a quick pass. I look forward to improving both production quality and reading. But it&amp;#8217;s fun to have read one of my favorite poems and captured it for later and maybe too, for others.</description>

      <description>Here is an interesting article. It feels like it might be subject to some (selection?) bias, but the outcome appeals to my sensibility. Key sentiment is below:
 My research revealed that lucky people generate good fortune via four basic principles. They are skilled at creating and noticing chance opportunities, make lucky decisions by listening to their intuition, create self-fulfilling prophesies via positive expectations, and adopt a resilient attitude that transforms bad luck into good.</description>

Most of my stuff goes on twitter now. Automatically posted in turn to facebook (and to a side-bar in this blog). Anyway, happy belated, self-congratulatory, anniversary to me and my writing. 🙂</description>

      <description>I first saw this (or something very much like it) on a poster in an admin&amp;#8217;s office in Altoona. It struck a chord with me, and I went looking for it tonight. This isn&amp;#8217;t the exact version I remember, and I can&amp;#8217;t find attributions for it. But it&amp;#8217;s a good reminder for me:

      <description>I wrote the following on my birthday, the day before we left for the UK for a month. Alas, our home router died that day too, so I didn&amp;#8217;t actually publish it. I&amp;#8217;m going to date-adjust the post back in time to when I actually wrote it instead of when I finally got back to the states and therefore around to publishing it.
Today, I turn 39. It&amp;#8217;s feeling kinda old.</description>

      <description>We took the Eurostar from London to Paris on Thursday, and returned today (Sunday). I took Thursday off, and then worked from &amp;#8220;Home&amp;#8221; on Friday. We have about a 15 (adult) minute walk from the flat to the Brighton train station. From there, it&amp;#8217;s a little under an hour to London, St. Pancras. From there, a little under three hours to Paris Gare de Nord. From there, 15 min on the Paris Metro and 5 minutes to the flat.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Iâ€™m writing this to you on my 38th birthday. This morning when I got you up out of your crib, you asked, â€œWhat day is today?â€ I replied, â€œMonday.â€ Then you said, â€œItâ€™s Mommyâ€™s birthday! Happy Birthday, Mommy!â€ And you gave me a hug.
Best. Birthday. Present. Ever.
A few hours later, we were running errands on foot and you wanted me to carry you, and I was already lugging two bags of groceries, and you wouldnâ€™t wear your sun hat, and you kept telling me to take mine off, and you cried and complained for the last two blocks.</description>

      <description>Dear Sammy,
Dad and I are a few weeks late with this newsletter. You (and the people we share this letter with) will have to forgive us: your 28th month was a difficult oneâ€”not because of you, but because this past month saw the death of a longtime family member: our beloved kitty Camus.
Iâ€™m going to start there. He died near the end of the month, but his death has colored the entire month.</description>

Still, it&amp;#8217;s a bit of a trip to run across. OK, I didn&amp;#8217;t really &amp;#8220;run across&amp;#8221; it &amp;#8212; he forwarded it to me. But there you go. A reporter got caught up in my dad&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;alternate reality&amp;#8221; field. Maybe that&amp;#8217;s why I&amp;#8217;ve been into virtual worlds for so long; I&amp;#8217;m just trying to recreate my childhood.</description>

      <description>Sam: I met a blue jay once at my house in California. He sat in my seat.
Dad: He sat in your car seat?
Sam: No, I sat in my car seat. He sat next to me. And a birdie sat next to me.
Dad: Isn&amp;#8217;t a blue jay a type of bird?
Sam: And the blue jay said &amp;#8220;Wow.&amp;#8221;
Dad: Wow?
Sam: &amp;#8220;WOW! [pause] There&amp;#8217;s some trees out there!</description>

      <description>I guess this really has been a bay area weekend. Yesterday, we went down to Berkeley partly just to wander, partly to pick up a kid-sized table and chairs for Sam that Carolyn arranged to buy through BPN but partly to go to Half Price Books. We were seeking the third book in the Song of Fire and Ice series &amp;#8212; A Storm of Swords. I gave up on the series after the first book &amp;#8212; too much soap opera, too little fantasy, but it engulfed Carolyn like a raging storm (of swords?</description>

      <description>Last weekend, we were dining at our favorite local Thai restaurant and we had a seating neighbor who was fairly loud. Since we&amp;#8217;re north of Berkeley (and in the San Francisco area), the fact that she was &amp;#8220;naturally&amp;#8221; dressed and appeared to be on a date with her female companion went completely without note. That she was on an easily overheard and extended rant about her neighbor&amp;#8217;s behavior was a little bit annoying.</description>

      <description>Sometimes, I can get into a groove with taking care of myself when my family&amp;#8217;s not around. I haven&amp;#8217;t found that groove yet. While I like the flexibility I get in timing, getting to go to &amp;#8220;Movie Nite&amp;#8221; with other Lindens, etc. I miss my family and look forward to getting them back. (They&amp;#8217;re at Mom-mom&amp;#8217;s house helping out while she gets a mitral valve repaired (!!!))
At least I get to talk to Sam on the phone pretty much every day.</description>

More recently, I was reviewing older, less relevant email streams came across http://icanhascheezburger.com/ &amp;#8212; too funny! Had to share. Enjoy.

      <description>Sam, Carolyn and I went for an outing today after Sam&amp;#8217;s afternoon nap. We generally try to do these things in the morning when we have a little more time, but it was a typically lazy Sunday morning complete with lying around on the couch, listening to jazz and a pancake breakfast, so morning wasn&amp;#8217;t happening.
Mom and Sam peer
from the bridge   &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; It was a sunny afternoon here in El Cerrito, but we could see the fog nestled around the city with only the transamerica building and one other poking out.</description>

      <description>The radio was an important part of my childhood. I was limited in the amount of (non-PBS) television I was allowed to watch, but there was no such limit on the radio. The 80&amp;#8217;s contained the complete range of my teen-hood, and I still have a fondness for &amp;#8217;80&amp;#8217;s music. Mostly my parents listened to NPR (WUNC &amp;#8211; Chapel Hill), so that was a big part of my childhood too. I have fond memories (to the point of idealized nostalgia) of listening to &amp;#8220;Prairie Home Companion&amp;#8221; by kerosene lantern after Saturday evening meals nestled in the &amp;#8220;shack&amp;#8221; in the mountain woods of Virginia.</description>

      <description>Dear Samantha,
Tomorrow you will turn 16 months old. Back in Pennsylvania, a little groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil will stick his little brown nose out of his hole-in-the-dirt house and venture out into the air. Hundreds of people will watch to see if he sees his shadow. If he does, folklore has it that there will be six more weeks of winter. If not, there will be an early spring. I was saying to your Dad the other day that I doubt people in the San Francisco Bay area pay much attention to Groundhog Day.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Already it&amp;#8217;s been almost a month and a half, since I&amp;#8217;ve written your newsletter. Yet, in some ways it seems to me like I just wrote your month 14 newsletter. I&amp;#8217;ll be fascinated to see how both of us have a changing perception of time as we both mature. I remember as a child ((I was about to write &amp;#8216;kid&amp;#8217; here, but then remembered that as a kid, I wouldn&amp;#8217;t let anyone refer to me as &amp;#8216;kid&amp;#8217; because it (also) meant &amp;#8216;baby goat.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
It&amp;#8217;s been a while since I (Dad) have written your monthly newsletter. I&amp;#8217;ve been fortunate that your mom has been willing to take up the challenge during the time that I was out in California without you guys, and during your transition out here. But I&amp;#8217;m back (and with a new interface on the blog) and do I get a great month to write about.

      <description>OK, it&amp;#8217;s not really her first steps, but today Sam walked unsupported for the first time in her life. Of course, I wasn&amp;#8217;t home for it. 🙁 But I did get to see a repeat performance later in the evening which I captured to share with you.
In other firsts today, Sam also cried when I left for work. She and mom stand at the picture window at the front of the house and wave as I go by (the path to the sidewalk is on the east side of the yard, and I head west on the sidewalk).</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Iâ€™ve been writing this letter to you in mind for weeks now, but until now I havenâ€™t managed to spill the words onto a page. I hope youâ€™ll cut me a little slack, because, you know, in addition to everything else going on during your 11th month, there was the little matter of that CROSS-COUNTRY move. Oh yes. You began this month in Altoona, PA and ended it in El Cerrito, CA.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Iâ€™m writing this to you in your Uncle Johnâ€™s old room at Gradyville, PA. You are asleep in my old room, clutching a toy car and set of plastic keys. The knees of your purple pants are filthy, your feet are covered in carpet fuzz and cat fur, and your round little tummy rises and falls rhythmically, straining against the straps of the car seat you fell asleep in.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m back in PA with my family. So nice to see them. It drives home my impatience for the resolution of this whole transition though.
I&amp;#8217;m not quite back to my former status with Sam, but I was clearly no stranger either.
The things that struck me most about her after having been gone for almost 2 months:
 Larger: Project Fatbaby has been largely successful.
 More alert: Actually attentive to things rather than just responsive to stimuli</description>

      <description>There was a time when it was perfectly normal to set an alarm to wake Sam up to feed between 2 and 3AM. At the time, those days seemed eternal, stretching out for miles. The notion of sleeping through the night too dim to even imagine in the distance. And then, of course, things changed. Now I am all too happy to forget that old routine.
Here&amp;#8217;s our current routine at Mom-mom and Granddaddy&amp;#8217;s:</description>

I have big shoes to fill (you can take that figuratively or literally, as you like, because yes, your daddy has big feet). Since your daddy spent this past month in California, it is up to me to provide the chronicle of your ninth month.
Nine months! Good lord, child, youâ€™ve now been out for as long as you were in. How did that happen? When I look at your impish smile and the light tripping in your eyes I can barely recall the tiny, sleepy newborn Sam that used to fit along the length of my arm from elbow to palm.</description>

 Thursday, I received a certified letter from the IRS containing a Notice of Deficiency which has to be cleared up in 90 days.
 The relo company &amp;#8212; which has had my approximate schedule for some time now &amp;#8212; now needs 3 weeks advance notice before having a surveyor come walk through the house and tell them how much it will cost to move us. Because it&amp;#8217;s summer.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve made a page for it, rather than a regular blog entry because I don&amp;#8217;t want it to fade from view (until it&amp;#8217;s sold). We listed our house on Monday with the Real Estate Agent who helped us buy it. It&amp;#8217;s such a treasure &amp;#8212; we don&amp;#8217;t want to leave it behind, but as good as the Linden Lab relocation budget is &amp;#8212; I don&amp;#8217;t think it would actually cover picking up the house and moving it to San Francisco.</description>

      <description>So, we&amp;#8217;ve been madly purging in preparation for this move. It&amp;#8217;s still quite difficult (though I&amp;#8217;ll have a whole mess of computer equipment to offer up shortly. Blog readers get first dibs, though I suspect I&amp;#8217;ll have to go to freecycle to get rid of it). Anyway, I came across a few grad school notes and papers, one notebook of which was full of various labs, tests and notes from my Perceptual Psychology class &amp;#8212; relevant to virtual worlds, of course.</description>

During a long walk during the winter time, Carolyn and I took stock of our lives as we tend to do during long walks together. We found ourselves out in the cold, walking among the depressed (and depressing) houses of Altoona with our baby daughter strapped to us.</description>

Writing this intro paragraph, I realize that already what follows is too long for a single blog post, and I&amp;#8217;m not even out of the back story yet. That said, I&amp;#8217;m not going to break it up further.</description>

      <description>Today, I&amp;#8217;m another year wiser, more mature, experienced and centered. I&amp;#8217;m also another year heavier, achier, creakier and more forgetful. I&amp;#8217;m never really sure what to make of birthdays any more. Somehow, I still have this expectation left over from childhood that they will be magical and wondrous in unimaginable ways. Needless to say, they end up being like most every other day, but for a scattering of presents, well wishes, and maybe a nice meal out.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been to the west coast twice in the past 5 years. Each time I&amp;#8217;ve been out there, I&amp;#8217;ve lost a grandmother. I&amp;#8217;m all out of grandmothers. Indeed, Ruth was the last of my grandparents to die. What follows was sent to me by one of my uncles, titled &amp;#8220;Ruth&amp;#8217;s magical journey of magicalness.&amp;#8221; While no life can be adequately expressed in text, especially in just a couple of pages of text, I find that this does give the reader a nice overview and glimpse into life of an extrodinary woman.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m in San Francisco tonight on business. It&amp;#8217;s the first night in my daughter&amp;#8217;s life that we&amp;#8217;ve not slept in the same room. It feels a little odd to be this out of touch &amp;#8212; the flight landed here after I hope both wife and daughter were well asleep.
I&amp;#8217;m in the &amp;#8220;Dirty Harry&amp;#8221; room of the Hotel Bijou. It&amp;#8217;s kinda cool in a funky, downtown-y way. I don&amp;#8217;t know if I&amp;#8217;m exactly in the red light district, but I&amp;#8217;m certainly not in the upscale neighborhood judging by the adult dvd mega stores, and the bars on the windows.</description>

      <description>Sorry I&amp;#8217;ve been so quiet recently. I actually have a few things to say, but have been having trouble focusing on this. Partly because of busy (baby still = handful, + clients, etc.), also because there&amp;#8217;s some stuff going on that I can&amp;#8217;t blog yet. I hate when that happens because I feel like it blocks up the rest of my creativity as well.
Anyway, the only real reason for this entry is to mention that there are a bunch of new pictures up of the world&amp;#8217;s cutest baby.</description>

      <description>Sometimes, product packaging has it just right.
Truth in advertising  Carolyn and I both like pistachios. But I like pistachio pudding, and Carolyn does not. I have a theory as to why &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s the color. I ate (and liked) pistachio pudding as a kid. It was yummy pudding, it was green, and you know, there were nuts in it, but no big deal. I just thought &amp;#8220;pistachio&amp;#8221; was a flavor of pudding &amp;#8212; sort of just a synonym for &amp;#8220;green.</description>

      <description>Something hit me in the middle of the night a couple of nights ago, and it hit hard. I don&amp;#8217;t know what it was, or where it came from. We&amp;#8217;d been out to Sams/Walmart earlier in the day, but I&amp;#8217;d washed my hands as soon as we got home. It started with a pain in the nose, and carried on to be an all out sinus flooding. It was as if my body said &amp;#8220;Why are we letting the little peanut be the top producer of bodily emissions?</description>

It must be true  Hi, I&amp;#8217;m AC Capehart. I&amp;#8217;m a Choicy White Boy.
On this blog, you&amp;#8217;ll find my general musings about life, the occasional thing that I find cool &amp;#8212; usually for its geekyness, and a great deal about my daughter, Samantha. Over time, this blog has evolved as my life has changed. The early part of the blog is just my musings/journaling about my life. Not long into it, my wife becomes pregnant and some number of months later (9-ish?</description>

      <description>I don&amp;#8217;t often remember my dreams. I don&amp;#8217;t often get enough sleep. (I didn&amp;#8217;t last night either, but when Sam went down for a nap this morning, I just had to join her!)
My dream started in a B&amp;amp;B with large, lush, flowing grounds. We&amp;#8217;d been there for the weekday part of a week with Carolyn&amp;#8217;s parents (and Sam)We&amp;#8217;d been talking about going to see Ca&amp;#8217;s parents some time (once Sam can communicate) where we&amp;#8217;d drop off Sam to stay with her grandparents, and we&amp;#8217;d stay in a nearby hotel a la fussy.</description>

      <description>I write a fair amount about my new daughter. Becoming a dad has shifted my life around quite a bit. As I write things about when she first smiled, or first rolled over, it was keeping the date of when those things happened, but the I&amp;#8217;d have to do date-math in my head to figure out how old she was. I don&amp;#8217;t like doing date-math in my head. So, I wrote a wordpress plugin to do it for me.</description>

      <description>This is the parent page for wordpress plugins that I write. It may end up being a fairly small list, but I&amp;#8217;ve been impressed with how easy it is to throw together a plugin for wordpress, so as other wordpress-thorns appear in my side, I may soothe the itch here. In the meanwhile, there&amp;#8217;s just &amp;#8220;Duration&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; A plugin to include how long it has been since some event (or until some event) calculated between the time the post was written, and an arbitrary event set by the blogger.</description>

      <description>I told Carolyn&amp;#8217;s voicemail the story of the forgotten wallet, and was therefore positively ebullient when she came home from work with two bags of Doritos. In snacking on these, I happened to read a little bit of the packaging. According to the bag, &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s the only snack bold enough to call itself Doritos &amp;reg; brand.&amp;#8221;
Well, yeah. Any other snack that was &amp;#8220;bold enough&amp;#8221; to call itself Doritos would have the pants sued off of them by Frito Lay.</description>

      <description>The most recent troubling forgetfulness happened today. But I need to preface this story with an introduction. I love Doritos. No, seriously, I looove Doritos. They were traveling food when I was a kid. I&amp;#8217;d be in the back seat of the VW bug as we went from Durham, NC up to the Shack in Virginia &amp;#8212; a rustic cabin in the blue ridge mountains. I hated the trip. 3 hours in the car every other weekend or so, but I loved being at the shack.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been forgetful in some genuinely annoying ways the past few days. Last Thursdayactually, it was the Thursday before that. Time sure flies when you&amp;#8217;re forgetful! I was dealing with the car. Nothing special, just checking the oil because of a burning smell. I decided to top it off as it was a little less than half a quart low. I keep the extra oil in one of the compartments in the rear.</description>

      <description>I enjoy puns, and wordplay, possibly to a fault. If I remember, I&amp;#8217;ll post some shaggy dogs at some point.
I read somewhere earlier today about someone sidling up to a bar, and that made me think about the word sidle.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#8217;s one of those words I only know from context, and that context is alwasy sidling up to a bar.&amp;nbsp; I inferred that the definition was just &amp;#8220;to approach&amp;#8221;, but I looked it up today to learn that it means to approach or move sideways (or furtively).</description>

      <description>It was one year ago today that I started blogging. This would be a good time for self-reflection on what&amp;#8217;s changed in the past year. However, one of the things that&amp;#8217;s changed in the past year, has me up at 3:00 AM warming up formula to feed her, and so I&amp;#8217;m too woozy from need of sleep to be introspective. Maybe something more appropriate will come to me during nap time later in the day.</description>

      <description>Just a quick note to say &amp;#8220;Happy New Year.&amp;#8221; The samtrak info that was just posted will be incomplete until we&amp;#8217;re back in Altoona and I have my daughter, wife, cat, food, and high-speed internet access all on the same level of the same house. I can then more easily update the SamTrak data, and I&amp;#8217;ll catch back up on all of the logged I/O. I expect posting activity will pick back up a little then too.</description>

I burned my finger (not badly, just enough to sting for a bit).
I was using the sink in the basement of the in-laws office when it pulled away from the wall. I called for help (sure lucky I had my cell phone on me!). Carolyn and John both came to help.</description>

      <description>Samantha,
Imagine if you will: You&amp;#8217;re on a TGV or Bullet Train. You&amp;#8217;re traveling through snowy, mountainous countryside. As you speed along, you pass through regularly spaced tunnels each a little bit longer and closer than the previous. As a result, it&amp;#8217;s alternately light and dark, and you hear a bit of a whoosh sound as you make each transition. That&amp;#8217;s what this past month has been like for me.</description>

      <description>Up here in central PA, I get my natural gas supply from Dominion. This confuses me just a little bit, because back in Charlottesville, I got my electricity supply from Dominion (gas came from the City of Charlottesville).
They recently sent me their furnace repair plan promotional material. Basically, they offer furnace insurance. Pay a little bit every month, then if your furnace fails, they fix it and you aren&amp;#8217;t stuck with a huge repair bill.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;#8217;t like to ask for help. I was raised to be an independent and self-sufficient individual, given more freedom and responsibility than most my age. This is doubly true when what I ask for help on is something that I am not only capable of doing myself, but should have already done. And it&amp;#8217;s still the more true when I&amp;#8217;m asking of a community of friends who have already been so incredibly generous.</description>

      <description>I find myself, at 10:00 in the evening, sitting in the basement illuminated only by the monitor and a small desk light, blasting techno through my headphones, and programming. Sometimes, life is gooood.</description>

      <description>About a month ago, I misplaced my pocket knife. Were I still living under my dad&amp;#8217;s roof, this would have been cause for great concern. &amp;#8220;A man without his pocketknife is a man without his pants,&amp;#8221; he would say. But I wasn&amp;#8217;t too worried. I was pretty sure it was still in the house, I also carry a leatherman tool on my belt, and I have a backup pocketknife. I found that I didn&amp;#8217;t carry the backup pocketknife though because it was too heavy; Too much weight bouncing around in my pocket.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m quite accustomed to &amp;#8220;Nigerian Scam Letters&amp;#8221; I&amp;#8217;ve been getting them for a long time. I&amp;#8217;ve even played with the idea of taking the bait and toying with the scammers a-la those at 419 eaters. But in wasting their time, I&amp;#8217;d also be wasting my own.
Today, however, I received a variant of the letter appealing to my desire to help Katrina victims:

      <description>Sorry about another test, but I set up a mailing list for the baby announcements, and I wanted to be sure that posts from my phone will go both to the blog and the mailing list.
The mailing list can be found at http://www.chaoslimited.com/mailman/listinfo/birth &amp;#8211; Moderator (my) approval is required for subscrption so that I can limit the email to people I know&amp;#8211;even if the same info will appear on the blog mere minutes later.</description>

      <description>(with apologies to dave matthews)
Carolyn said I shouldn&amp;#8217;t do it. But I did. I got &amp;#8220;choicywhiteboy.com&amp;#8221;. I don&amp;#8217;t think there&amp;#8217;s going to be a rush on the domain. It only has meaning for me. But this way blog title and address can sync up &amp;#8212; you only have to remember one! For that matter, I took the next logical step and got the AIM ID &amp;#8220;choicywhiteboy&amp;#8221;. I wonder if I&amp;#8217;m going to get as tired of this name as I did of A Life More Ordinary.</description>

      <description>This is not a press release; Amazon.com&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;operating agreement&amp;#8221;:http://associates.amazon.com/gp/associates/agreement/103-7418193-3929441 specifically forbids my issuing a press release. But, this is a blog entry that mentions that I&amp;#8217;ve become an amazon &amp;#8220;affiliate.&amp;#8221; This just means that the links that I make to amazon have some remote chance of earning me a little bit of money. Actually, I&amp;#8217;m set up so they&amp;#8217;ll earn me amazon gift certificate instead of money.
That I became an Amazon affiliate, I probably wouldn&amp;#8217;t mention except that I was amused by the automatically-chosen associate ID.</description>

      <description>OK. I&amp;#8217;m declaring my blog &amp;#8220;done enough&amp;#8221; at this point. I&amp;#8217;ve re-introduced the Google &amp;#8220;AdSense&amp;#8221; ads. Which, as I&amp;#8217;m sure you know is important to my revenue plans for this site. I&amp;#8217;ve earned an average of a little over 43 cents every month since I started Adsense. Of course, they don&amp;#8217;t cut a check until you&amp;#8217;ve accumulcated a credit of $100. At this rate, I&amp;#8217;ll get my first check in 19.</description>

      <description>I spent far too much of today copying the old blogger entries into wordpress. I suspect it was still faster than writing a parser to scan previous entries and dump them into the mysql database that wordpress uses, though I&amp;#8217;m not sure. The main thing that I&amp;#8217;ve not done is to move over the image-only posts. Oh, and figure out comments. There were several nice and interesting comments that elaborated on entries that will be lost with the current transition.</description>

      <description>Last weekend we spent in West Townshend, VT at the Windham Hill Inn. The occasion was the wedding of my brother-in-law John Fay to Rika Suzuki.
There is a lifestyle that I am impressed with when I get these fleeting glimpses of it. I saw it in a couple of the Newscorp politicos that I worked with when Kesmai was a Newscorp entity. I caught several glimpses of it last weekend.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;d been thinking about switching blog tools for a while. I liked blogger, but I wasn&amp;#8217;t completely satisfied with it. Mainly, I was missing having categories. Then, I started installing a new machine to act as the primary server for accapehart.com. I got it serving web pages no problem. However, because it has a different SSH host identity, but the same username/password/IP Address, blogger failed to connect to it. So, I wrote to blogger support.</description>

      <description>When the web was infantile, there was no real way to know what was new. During its toddler stage, information about new websites was passed around via email or on USENET. Eventually, there became too many sites being created for this to be a reasonable way to keep up. (A similar issue plagued the single /etc/hosts file, but that&amp;#8217;s a different story.)
Finally, there came Yahoo. Now, there was a directory for the web.</description>

      <description>Maybe not everybody else knows about this, but I sure felt out of the loop when I discovered it. I saw my first PhotoStamp today. The photo&amp;#8217;s of my uncle&amp;#8217;s first grandchild. It was on a card he sent my mom. MY MOM knew about photostamps before I did. Sometimes, I get the false impression that because things in Altoona seem to move slowly, that things outside of Altoona also move slowly.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m trying the bk lifestyle today. It&amp;#8217;s been pretty nice, but I&amp;#8217;ve found it a bit distracting. The grandkids are next door. It was somebody&amp;#8217;s birthday. There was lots of running around and swimming, etc.
I guess I should explain what I mean by the bk lifestyle. My friend bk is doing editing work for the Ludwig von Mises Institute. He does this predominately on his powerbook. When he&amp;#8217;s in Charlottesville, which he is this month, he spends most of his time doing his computing on his back deck.</description>

The electrician has come and gone. And while he&amp;#8217;ll be back, it should be just to put a space-saving breaker in my breaker box to split out the circuit that feeds the computer UPS. And so, we&amp;#8217;re taken care of. In the two bedrooms upstairs, we have 2 data ports, one phone and one cable TV. We have 3 data and 1 cable in the den (that reminds me, I should go ahead and pre-order my Xbox 360), 2 data in the living room, one in the entry hallway for the wireless access point, and each of us has 3 data lines and one phone line for our desks in our basement office space.</description>

      <description>Before we moved in, I had called a couple of electricians for estimates &amp;#8212; I want to run data wiring (and phone and cable) to many of the rooms. Said electricians came by the house, eventually, one called me back and gave me a price and a schedule. It seemed pretty reasonable, though later than I wanted. I&amp;#8217;d assumed they could have it done before we moved in. Oh well.</description>

Chocolate Milk is what had been on the walls in the entry-way, living room and dining room in our new house. I think I described it as Salmon in an earlier post. It still seems a little too pink to be Chocolate Milk, but it is probably a little too brown to be Salmon.</description>

      <description>Well, one it, at least. We&amp;#8217;ve closed. We have the house. It was, all things considered really easy. We met the realtor at her office and she drove us down to the title company where the closing was. We had quite a crowd there at the beginning. The seller, her daughter, and her realtor. The bank representative, the two of us with our realtor and the closing agent. After the first few batches of papers were signed, it thinned out a bit as the seller left.</description>

Then out to Champaign, IL where we got a brief driving tour of the campus by my uncle Cam who&amp;#8217;s undergrad and law degrees both came from there.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m going to tempt fate again. Carolyn (wisely) suggested &amp;#8220;Why don&amp;#8217;t you write it offline first?&amp;#8221; And that really was a good suggestion. Only, I like to tempt fate &amp;#8212; at least with small things that don&amp;#8217;t really matter. And while I&amp;#8217;d like to tell you about my motorcycling, It&amp;#8217;s hardly really important. So, here I am again; in the blogger window, writing about motorcycling.

      <description>The onslaught of spam bounces continues. After a little further exploration, and discussions with the folks on the chuug list, we&amp;#8217;ve determined that a spammer is using randomstring@accapehart.com as the &amp;#8220;From:&amp;#8221; address for spam that he/she is sending out. As a result, for every message that is not successfully sent, I get a bounce back from the friendly MTA saying that they couldn&amp;#8217;t deliver the message I was trying to send.</description>

      <description>Joe, the author of Dadblog &amp;#8212; one of the 2 blogs that I read where I don&amp;#8217;t know the author &amp;#8212; wrote to me today. Apparently, he was looking through his web log analysis software, and saw a referrer he didn&amp;#8217;t recognize (my blog). He checked me out and correctly deduced that we have a common friend in Clinton.
This spurred me to check my own logs. 
Almost everything was as I expected but for 2 things:</description>

      <description>I need to learn to draw. My website needs art. And I need to stop stealing it. :-/ I would love to be able to draw in an anime style. OK, I&amp;#8217;d love to be able to draw in any style. I just love how anime seems to be able to do so much with so little. I want to learn to be better with my camera too.
As far as music, when I was in middle/jr/high school, when people asked &amp;#8220;What do you play?</description>

      <description>Every now and again, I&amp;#8217;d been seeing little bits of Spanish on the web. But it didn&amp;#8217;t occur to me as to why until I was publishing my last blog entry.
There is a designer in the Neon Guild1who is proposing to do a site for a client. The designer talked to Jack about doing internationalization for the client. Jack talked to me. I experimented with it (here) to make sure I knew what I&amp;#8217;d do.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s been a little slow the last few days. Monday night I helped Carolyn arrange her desk in her new office. She switched buildings because they are going to expand the library to use both floors &amp;#8212; including the one her office was in. Her new office is smaller than most of the rest, but has a double-expanse of window to make up for it. It&amp;#8217;s certainly a step up from the closet they had her in before!</description>

      <description>Now two recent posts have been lost to the ether. The first one, a few days ago about motorcycling, I clicked &amp;#8220;publish&amp;#8221; and got a server error. When I clicked &amp;#8220;back&amp;#8221; the form field was empty.
Just now, I had a long, long talk about bicycling. I took a quick break to check email before posting because I wanted to give a moment to see if I really wanted to be that incendiary.</description>

      <description>(with apologies to Wallace &amp;amp; Gromit for the title.)
Today was my birthday, though I pretty much used the whole weekend to celebrate.
Yesterday, I borrowed a motorcycle from a friend of a friend (how cool is that!?!) and went for a motorcycle ride with about 8 others in a motley collection of motorcycles (only 2 were even from the same manufacturer!). We headed south from Altoona along twisty back roads and found ourselves (with a little bit of searching) at the Road Kill Caf&amp;eacute;.</description>

      <description>We had an odd outage recently. It started last night, and continued through today. I had figured it was just another random network outage granted us by our benevolent cable company. I figured they were aware of it and working on it. But as it stretched on toward 24 hours, I thought I should at least call and check on it with them. I was surprised and worried when they said &amp;#8220;No, no known problems in that area.</description>

      <description>A website entirely unrelated to the content of this blog entry provoked the entry. I cracked up at this guy&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;camtoons&amp;#8221;, and thought that I really needed to share &amp;#8217;em. I guess I&amp;#8217;ll add them to funny in my wiki too. But the way I found that guy&amp;#8217;s camtoons was from his page where he had linked to a picture of his motorcycle. You see, I&amp;#8217;ve been lusting after a new motorcycle since&amp;#8230; well, pretty much since I sold my previous motorcycle in the move to Altoona.</description>

      <description>Through another randomish web walk, I came upon someone&amp;#8217;s home page that had various Gay &amp;amp; Lesbian support banners, and included a(n incorrect) link to &amp;#8220;The Equality Project&amp;#8221;. Seeing that, I thought that gay pride was under-represented on my web page. I was looking for a rainbow icon, and a reasonable place to link it to when I came across the &amp;#8220;Homo Depot&amp;#8221;. Just the name cracked me up and they have lots of interesting fridge magnets, buttons etc.</description>

      <description>I was wandering through Netflix (not quite as fun as wandering through a &amp;#8220;real&amp;#8221; movie store, but much cheaper!), and I came across The Experiment which I added to my queue. I was interested to read one reviewer say that it was clearly based on the Stanford Prison Experiment which a quick google search turned up for me.
I enjoy psychology, even though I did rather poorly in it in college.</description>

      <description>We were in Florida for a conference of Carolyn&amp;#8217;s last week. She gave what I thought was a kick-ass close reading of a French novel I&amp;#8217;d never heard of. Unfortunately, the audience was the same size as the panel itself (not including the moderator!)
It was sunny and in the 80&amp;#8217;s. I went walking along a nice, paved rail-trail. I soo wish I&amp;#8217;d thought to bring my roller blades. We went to Cedar Key.</description>

      <description>Now that that bit of info (Carolyn is pregnant) is out there, I can talk about it. I was playing with gizoogle because I was updating my home page to include searches. Gizoogle&amp;#8217;s just another dialectizer, but more closely coupled to Google&amp;#8217;s searching.
While adding Gizoogle, I tested it with the phrase &amp;#8220;something fun&amp;#8221; and came across http://www.kneebouncers.com. I&amp;#8217;m (mildly) embarrassed to say how much fun I had there. I imagined my child on my lap slapping at the keyboard and watching the guitar play, or the drums.</description>

      <description>Well, after much back and forth, we have an agreement to buy the house. It should be a happy occasion, and truthfully, it mostly is. But I&amp;#8217;m still a bit pissy about $250.00. That&amp;#8217;s right. We&amp;#8217;ve come to an agreement on approximately $150,000, and I&amp;#8217;m pissy about $250.00. Let me break it down for you.
First, the seller is an old lady. A recent widow who&amp;#8217;s lived in that house since 1973.</description>

      <description>We re-visited house #1 today &amp;#8212; 512 28th Ave (I took another huge batch of pictures this trip). We&amp;#8217;re going to make an offer tomorrow. I&amp;#8217;m scared. I don&amp;#8217;t remember being this scared about Gateway circle, but I don&amp;#8217;t remember emotions much anyway. I&amp;#8217;m not exactly sure why I&amp;#8217;m scared. I guess it&amp;#8217;s just financial. I&amp;#8217;m worried about failing to make payments, or having the C&amp;#8217;ville house go un-rented and having to pay two mortgages when it feels like we&amp;#8217;re stretched paying just our rent right now.</description>

      <description>I got two surprises in my gas bill today. The first really pisses me off. The second confuses me. The first is that they &amp;#8220;estimated&amp;#8221; my gas usage. Though if they used anything as advanced as mathematics in estimating my gas usage, it would surprise me. Somehow, they thought that during the shortest (and albeit coldest) month of the year, I would manage to use 3.7 TIMES my average monthly usage; That the gas I used in February would some how be approximately half of ALL of the gas that I used from July up until February.</description>

      <description>We went to visit the inlaws over spring break. Well, my inlaws; her parents. It was nice. The Philadelphia area is different from Altoona. Plus, they take us out to nice dinners!
One of the many family jokes or elements of folklore, or what have you, is my penchant for barber shops. Barber shops are great. They&amp;#8217;re almost always a source of local color, and I don&amp;#8217;t understand paying $18 for someone at a &amp;#8220;salon&amp;#8221; to cut my hair when I can get it cut for almost half the price by someone with probably twice the experience.</description>

      <description>Every now and again, I look through my awstats for my web logs. It was really fascinating when I first set it up. Now, I look at it maybe once a week. Soon, I&amp;#8217;m sure it&amp;#8217;ll dwindle to once a month. Mostly, I get a kick out what people were searching for when they wind up on my pages.
Usually, it&amp;#8217;s stuff that makes sense. My flying info was pretty useful and interesting when I put it up, and I typed up the checklist that the flight school gave me for the Cessna 152 I was flying.</description>

      <description>Well, the &amp;#8220;70&amp;#8217;s palace&amp;#8221; that I talked about here has been sold. And no, not to us. I went for a bike ride yesterday and rode by the house. The for sale signs were gone, and there was a pickup in the drive way and stuff in the garage.
On that same bike ride, however, I went past a house that I&amp;#8217;d ridden past in the fall. In the fall, it was a FSBO, that when I finally got around to showing to Carolyn, the for sale sign was already gone.</description>

      <description>It should be a surprise to no one given my &amp;#8220;north wing&amp;#8221; political views that I&amp;#8217;m not a big fan of taxes. I just don&amp;#8217;t get the justification for the government to take approximately a third of my income. It certainly didn&amp;#8217;t make my work a third easier. And that&amp;#8217;s just income taxes. Every time I buy something, there&amp;#8217;s sales tax. Every time I trade in the stock market, there&amp;#8217;s capital gains taxes.</description>

While cathartic, it rarely makes for good reading. I&amp;#8217;m going to try again. And I&amp;#8217;m going to try to keep this coherent. Whether I succeed is yet to be determined.
I am provoked by a recent Reuters news piece which can be read from Wired News here.</description>

      <description>I was afraid of this, when I started. Creativity drought. Some of the things I have to say, simply can&amp;#8217;t be said yet. Others seem too mundane to say. Still more might be appropriate for this forum but feel like they&amp;#8217;ve arrived just so that I have something to say here.
I will doubtless have some stories next week though. This weekend will be interesting. I&amp;#8217;m going down to Richmond to spend some time with my dad for his birthday.</description>

      <description>A couple of days ago, my wife saw my new home page on her computer. As a mac user, she&amp;#8217;s used to sites not really being designed with her in mind, so she called me over to ask &amp;#8220;It is supposed to look like this?&amp;#8221;
Unfortunately, it was. It looked just like I had intended it to look. It may be clear at this point, that though I&amp;#8217;ve spent just about all of my adult life in front of a computer, a web designer I am not.</description>

      <description>According to my recollection of Straczynski&amp;#8217;s commentary around Babylon 5 or at least as much as I heard before muting it because he started dishing out spoilers, those were the two main questions of Bab5: Who are you? and What do you want?
Personally, I don&amp;#8217;t think &amp;#8220;Who are you?&amp;#8221; is a very interesting question, because I think the answer is too complex to be interesting or useful. I don&amp;#8217;t think we (or at least I) have a good map for that territory.</description>

      <description>When I was a young &amp;#8216;en, maybe about 16, I lived in (two of) the poorer sections of the richest school district around. A school district my parents had moved into three years earlier &amp;#8211; and shortly before their divorce &amp;#8212; specifically so that I could go to the good county schools instead of the crappy city schools. All, in all, it was not bad. I got the fancy education, but I was not as insulated in my upper-crust world as other school-mates of mine.</description>

When did I do the MS 150? I bought the bike I&amp;#8217;m pictured on partly for that ride. Anyway, somewhere on the order of 5-6 years ago. I intended it to be a placeholder.</description>

      <description>I suppose that one never really knows what one&amp;#8217;s impact on the world will be.
In anticipation of heightened traffic as bk&amp;#8217;s blog readers were notified of the existence of my blog, I installed awstats. I had done that a few machines ago, but at the time doing even a basic config for a web server was a PITA. Or, at least I thought it was then. Now, it&amp;#8217;s pretty trivial, and I&amp;#8217;ve lumped all my *accapehart.</description>

      <description>I made a promise that I regret. I told bk that if I posted two more blog entries in the coming 7 days that he could announce my (unread) blog on his (somewhat more read) blog. I regret this not because I fear my voice being heard by the unwashed masses &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s been too long since my shower anyway &amp;#8212; no, I regret it because it&amp;#8217;s got me thinking about number and size of blog content in a way that feels inappropriate to the spirit of blogging.</description>

      <description>In setting up a wiki for a client (PeopleSpace), I was reminded about how terribly cool this technology is. So, I set myself up one using a Ruby Wiki called Instiki. It&amp;#8217;s here: http://wiki.accapehart.com/</description>

      <title>Computers – The anti-zen?</title>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m writing this after the fact (by a couple of days) instead of as it was intended (by a couple of hours). Still interesting (to me).
I&amp;#8217;m on a vacation of sorts, in Southern Maryland, or SOMD as I&amp;#8217;ve taken to calling it1. I decided not to bring my laptop because I had a certain confidence there would be no Internet connectivity where we were staying. My cell phone broke, so today, I&amp;#8217;m really disconnected.</description>

      <title>Lessons (not) Learned</title>

      <description>Today I was driving around south-east Baltimore along some busy-ish highway (695?) (97?) when the two lanes of traffic I was in went down to one due to construction. The signs said that the right lane was closed in 1&amp;frasl;2 mile, merge left. I was already in the left lane, so in good shape. As other drivers heeded the warning and worked their way left, the left lane became more crowded and slower.</description>

      <title>Folding Game Design</title>

      <description>I had written something like this earlier, but it disappeared into the ether with a 500 Error from blogger.com. What follows is a re-creation, doubtless somewhat more organized, but less impassioned than the original.)
I don&amp;#8217;t like folding laundry. And I don&amp;#8217;t understand folding proteins. But, thanks to Folding@Home I&amp;#8217;m now doing my part toward their goal to understand protein folding, protein aggregation, and related diseases. But, it&amp;#8217;s not the hidden-bio-geek in me that&amp;#8217;s enjoying this.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;d been getting a bit weary of the perpetual gray of a dusky-overcast Altoona. It snowed yesterday, and it&amp;#8217;s sunny today. It may be freakin&amp;#8217; cold out, but at least it&amp;#8217;s a much prettier view out the office window today.
(There, I did it. I hate reading other people&amp;#8217;s long blog entries. What have they got to say that can&amp;#8217;t be said in a paragraph or two, and why would I want to read all that?</description>

      <title>A New Hope</title>

      <description>OK, not really much hope &amp;#8212; hope and fear being opposite sides of the same coin. I guess I do fear that I will not continue to blog. I&amp;#8217;ve tried journaling several times in my life, without much success. Fortunately, as there is not much hope, there is also not much fear. If I don&amp;#8217;t continue to blog, then I&amp;#8217;m exactly as out of touch with people as I already am.</description>
