      <description>I came across an interesting &amp;#8220;installation&amp;#8221; today at MIT. I think someone I follow tweeted it. It was interesting to me how it categorized my presence. The big bars were &amp;#8220;online&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;management&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;education&amp;#8221;. &amp;#8220;sports&amp;#8221; is bigger than it has any right to be. It was interesting to see some of the things it grabbed. References to me from former professors, test emails to lists I set up while at IATH, my &amp;#8220;temporary&amp;#8221; home page.</description>

      <description>This quote came through email recently in the office:
 &amp;#8220;You know what itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re chatting to your robot friend whilst skydiving from a floating marshmallow castle when you realise youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re late for work.&amp;#8221;
 The broader email was about the launch of Vodafone in Second Life. ðŸ™‚</description>

      <description>This link made the rounds at work today. I shared it with bk and Carolyn, my only (semi-)regular non-Linden workday correspondents, and Carolyn suggested I blog it. I won&amp;#8217;t steal the thunder from the article to recreate it here, but it&amp;#8217;s a short read and reasonably insightful if perhaps a little over-broad. It&amp;#8217;s about the &amp;#8220;tact filter&amp;#8221; and its orientation between nerds and &amp;#8220;normal&amp;#8221; people. [[In an age where people have &amp;#8216;(re)claimed&amp;#8217; geekness to the point where &amp;#8216;athletics geek&amp;#8217; is no longer a completely laughable oxymoron, is there such a thing as a &amp;#8216;normal&amp;#8217; person?</description>

      <description>People have complained (or admired) Apple computer for its effective product launches and getting a great deal of excitement about upcoming or just released products. This has not escaped the watchful eye of the onion. Probably a quarter of the people in my office already have the iPhone.
And yet truth is at least as strange as fiction as I saw this teaser at the top of another commuter&amp;#8217;s paper today: &amp;#8220;Apple ready to announce what&amp;#8217;s next.</description>

      <description>Well, as you can see from the sidebar change, I added &amp;#8220;Now Reading&amp;#8221; rather than writing my own. That&amp;#8217;s OK. I&amp;#8217;ll find something else to geek out on soon enough. I&amp;#8217;m wondering if I should generalize it to &amp;#8220;Now Consuming&amp;#8221; and add DVD&amp;#8217;s we&amp;#8217;re watching and games I&amp;#8217;m playing.</description>

      <description>OK, I just learned that there&amp;#8217;s now a facebook application called &amp;#8220;the love machine&amp;#8221; which is quite similar to the one we use at work &amp;#8212; except that it&amp;#8217;s out there for everyone to use!
Curiously, it was created by Ooga Labs who have our CEO as an advisor (on their board?). As our CTO has said, (paraphrasing) &amp;#8220;Now that facebook has announced their API/platform, never build another in-house social networking app&amp;#8221;.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m not exactly sure why my wife wanted me to take this quiz, much less post it. But she wanted both, so here it is. I&amp;#8217;d say that about the only thing interesting about it is that I grew up in the south, and both of my parents have stronger southern accents than I do. My mom is from the midwest though, and Durham is a rather cultured city at least compared to stereotypes of the south ðŸ™‚</description>

      <description>A friend of mine from work, Yoz, keeps introducing me (sometimes, indirectly) to addictive little shockwave games. Here&amp;#8217;s another one of them: Desktop Tower Defense. The main problem is that it can take a good deal of time to get through. But like all good games, the time goes really quickly, at least subjectively!</description>

      <description>The radio was an important part of my childhood. I was limited in the amount of (non-PBS) television I was allowed to watch, but there was no such limit on the radio. The 80&amp;#8217;s contained the complete range of my teen-hood, and I still have a fondness for &amp;#8217;80&amp;#8217;s music. Mostly my parents listened to NPR (WUNC &amp;#8211; Chapel Hill), so that was a big part of my childhood too. I have fond memories (to the point of idealized nostalgia) of listening to &amp;#8220;Prairie Home Companion&amp;#8221; by kerosene lantern after Saturday evening meals nestled in the &amp;#8220;shack&amp;#8221; in the mountain woods of Virginia.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A good friend of mine has (re-)entered the blog-o-sphere with a blog named &lt;a href=&#34;http://beauframe.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;beauframe&lt;/a&gt;. He starts with a subway story. I recommend you &lt;a href=&#34;http://beauframe.blogspot.com/2006/07/her-name-is-africa.html&#34;&gt;read it first&lt;/a&gt;. His telling of his experience reminded me to blog a somewhat related subway (BART) experience I had recently.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>One of the things the I like about being back in a small technology company is the feeling of being more &amp;#8220;in the loop&amp;#8221; for various (memes?) (cultural references?). While I doubt either of these qualify as memes, they both pleased me enough in some way to want to share them with you:
 &amp;#8220;Spock Casa&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; An impressively animated feature of Spock showing off his crib. (1 min) Boten Anna &amp;#8212; Basshunter&amp;#8217;s song about a man who falls in love with an IRC bot.</description>

      <description>As you may recall, we had some trouble picking Sam&amp;#8217;s name. While I love my daughter Sam, her name still seems a little random. We wanted something relatively unique, but still not so uncommon as to be a source of teasing, or misunderstanding. The latter was the major strike against Ana&amp;iuml;s &amp;#8212; a name both Carolyn and I like. Alas, the uniqueness was also called into question when within a month of her birth, I received an email from another Samantha Capehart!</description>

      <description>There are plenty of What&amp;#8217;s your [insert topic] name? memes running around &amp;#8212; we even did these before we had the internet to do them with. At the time, the memes (though we didn&amp;#8217;t call them that) were the specific rules that made up your name. For example your soap opera name was made up of your first pet followed by street you grew up on. My soap opera character was the androgynous Buffy Green.</description>

      <description>OK, it&amp;#8217;s not that I&amp;#8217;m always the last to know things. But it seems like I don&amp;#8217;t act very quickly on things that I do hear. (Recall being amazed at photo postage when I saw it &amp;#8212; only 6 months (or more) after I first heard about it).
Well, it&amp;#8217;s happened again. Pandora has been floating around in my periphery for some time now. It&amp;#8217;s a &amp;#8220;music discovery service&amp;#8221; that I just &amp;#8220;discovered&amp;#8221;One of my favorite David Sedaris quotes concerns qualities he was looking for in a boyfriend &amp;#8212; &amp;#8220;He must not say he &amp;#8216;discovered&amp;#8217; a restaurant that was right there in the phone book all along.</description>

      <description>When I was growing up, I didn&amp;#8217;t have to worry about what my parents wrote about me. Neither of them wrote much. OK, my mom&amp;#8217;s great about letters and cards, and my dad&amp;#8217;s pretty good about postcards from key locations, or travel events. And I know my mom journals. But that kind of communication is, I think, fundamentally different from the public forum of blogging. As I continue to be a daddy blogger, I pay attention to others of the same ilk.</description>

      <description>The theme for this week&amp;#8217;s Word-a-Day is interesting. It&amp;#8217;s all about the positive versions of words we always hear in the negative. Here are the introductory paragraphs from today&amp;#8217;s word (sipid):
 Why is there so much negativity around us? Open a newspaper, watch
TV, listen to the radio, and you find nothing but negative words.
Ever wonder why some words almost always appear in their negative
forms? It&amp;#8217;s completely evitable, as the words for the next five</description>

      <description>I tend to think of the server that my in-laws use for their business: http://www.fayrealestate.com/ as falling in the same category as my other &amp;#8220;personal&amp;#8221; machines &amp;#8212; like the one that hosts this blog, and http://www.santaal.com/ and so forth. I need to start thinking of them as clients instead.
Yesterday, they were having some trouble. I did some investigation and found that a awstats vulnerability had been exploited. I was sure I&amp;#8217;d password-protected the awstats pages, but when I looked through the apache configs, I found no such thing.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;#8217;t think he reads my blog, at least not with any regularity, but yesterday my brother-in-law IM&amp;#8217;ed me this URL: a newsgroup I posted to in 1991, in which I discuss a variety of topics from the LPMud I was helping run at the time, to the future of VR, to teledildonics &amp;#8212; all on a thread started by Howard Rheingold.
Does anything on the internet ever really die? Who reads a nntp://sci.</description>

      <description>I was reading on The long tail, the blog authored by the editor-in-chief of Wired magazine, that he doesn&amp;#8217;t visit mainstream media sites directly any more. He gets all of his news filtered through a select (but large) group of bloggers, figuring that if it mattered, it would get blogged about, and so he&amp;#8217;d come across it. I had a friend and office-mate that treated a few mailing lists that way.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s been a while since I&amp;#8217;ve stumbled across something on the web that made me chuckle quite like &amp;#8220;stuff on my cat&amp;#8221;. I was looking for new themes for wordpress, because when I get stuck on what I&amp;#8217;m working on, it&amp;#8217;s easier to fantasize about how my blog could look than fix whatever is stumping me at the moment. One link lead to another lead to stuff on my cat. Of course, they claim to be mentioned in GQ and several other magazines, so it&amp;#8217;s hardly a discovery.</description>

      <description>For reasons that I won&amp;#8217;t go into here (If you&amp;#8217;re lucky, maybe I&amp;#8217;ll tell you later. If you&amp;#8217;re really lucky, maybe you can guess.) I Googled on &amp;#8220;PBF NSFW&amp;#8221;. (OK, Actually, I A9&amp;#8217;ed. I like saving money at Amazon). Anyway, the first link was just PBF archive. I went. I saw that &amp;#8220;PBF&amp;#8221; stood for &amp;#8220;Perry Bible Fellowship&amp;#8221;, and I stopped right there. After all, I had just done a Google (and yes, this time I mean Google) blogsearch on Altoona, and found the top entry was the Altoona First Southern Baptist Church Men&amp;#8217;s Ministry Blog.</description>

      <description>Reviewing links on Choicy White Boy, I noticed that there&amp;#8217;s a link to the blog of the Author of the WordPress Theme I&amp;#8217;m using (journalized-winter). I checked it out, and saw that he had a &amp;#8220;nerd score&amp;#8221; of 92. Pretty nerdy, I thought. So, I took the quiz. I should learn not to take quizes. In other online quizes, I learned that I was a satanist, who my &amp;#8220;inner rock star&amp;#8221; was (Chris Isaac?</description>
