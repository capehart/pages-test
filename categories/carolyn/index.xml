      <description>We&amp;#8217;ve been making an &amp;#8220;outgoing&amp;#8221; chart to help Sam, in social situations, to be more, well, social. She&amp;#8217;s been doing a good job, and recently completed said chart so as a reward, we&amp;#8217;re going to Fairyland in Oakland. This morning, we were talking about the day and she said she was going to go as a fairy. Because it&amp;#8217;s fairy land. Mom asked what Mom and Dad should go as.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Iâ€™m writing this to you on my 38th birthday. This morning when I got you up out of your crib, you asked, â€œWhat day is today?â€ I replied, â€œMonday.â€ Then you said, â€œItâ€™s Mommyâ€™s birthday! Happy Birthday, Mommy!â€ And you gave me a hug.
Best. Birthday. Present. Ever.
A few hours later, we were running errands on foot and you wanted me to carry you, and I was already lugging two bags of groceries, and you wouldnâ€™t wear your sun hat, and you kept telling me to take mine off, and you cried and complained for the last two blocks.</description>

      <description>Dear Sammy,
For your newsletter describing your 30th month of life, Iâ€™ve been collecting phrases that weâ€™ve heard around the house. These are the ones that make your Dad and me grin, or gasp, or sometimes grimace. But in each case, we look at each other and mouth â€œdid she just say that?â€
Here you go. Soundbites from a 2Â½ year-old girl:
â€œMommies donâ€™t go to work. Daddies do.â€
â€œIâ€™m not a big girl yet.</description>

      <description>Dear Sammy,
Dad and I are a few weeks late with this newsletter. You (and the people we share this letter with) will have to forgive us: your 28th month was a difficult oneâ€”not because of you, but because this past month saw the death of a longtime family member: our beloved kitty Camus.
Iâ€™m going to start there. He died near the end of the month, but his death has colored the entire month.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
When I put you down for your afternoon nap just now, you sang along to your bedtime song â€œSamantha, fais dodo.â€ I was trying not to smile too hard, because, you knowâ€¦ itâ€™s nap time and you have a hard enough time as it is settling down to rest. When we finished the song, you exclaimed â€œSammy did it!â€ After I left the room, you reprised the song, and then added a few rounds of â€œFrÃ¨re Jacques,â€ followed by a rousing rendition of â€œPop Goes the Weasel.</description>

      <description>I wrote a long and detailed trip report on my recent SIGGRAPH trip for work.&amp;nbsp; I was figuring to simply copy-paste it here, but in review, it seems a little too Linden-centric, so over the next couple of days I&amp;#8217;ll try to figure out how best to excerpt it/restructure it to bring it out here.&amp;nbsp; I was embarrassed that Carolyn had (until just now) written my two most recent blog entries and even so they were a month apart.</description>

      <description>Dear Sammy,
Daddy was going to write your letter this month, but since a) heâ€™s sick, and b) heâ€™s working for SIGGRAPH at San Diego this week, and c) youâ€™re giving me a nice long nap this afternoon, I decided that I would start it.
So, hi Sammy! Happy 22 months old! Youâ€™re two months away from two years old. Technically. In practical terms, youâ€™re right smack dab in the middle of the Terrible Twoâ€™s.</description>

      <description>Dear Sammy,
I have a lot to tell you about this past month, but first let me tell you a little anecdote that has completely charmed your father and me. We still end your day with a reading of Time for Bed (by Mem Fox)â€”a little story book we received when you were born. Weâ€™ve been reading it to you since you were about 4 months old. Each page has a little rhyme about a parent animal telling the baby animal that itâ€™s time for sleep.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
April has always been one of my favorite months, as it usually heralds the arrival of spring: longer, lighter days, breezy weather, delicate daffodils, and peeping baby frogs. Academics, however, like to quote T.S. Eliotâ€™s â€œThe Waste Landâ€ and proclaim that â€œApril is the cruelest month.â€ While it is true that the last month of the academic semester usually entails a mountain of grading, I always welcomed April gladly because it meant that the end of tedium and the beginning of May freedom was near.</description>

      <description>Dear Samantha,
Tomorrow you will turn 16 months old. Back in Pennsylvania, a little groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil will stick his little brown nose out of his hole-in-the-dirt house and venture out into the air. Hundreds of people will watch to see if he sees his shadow. If he does, folklore has it that there will be six more weeks of winter. If not, there will be an early spring. I was saying to your Dad the other day that I doubt people in the San Francisco Bay area pay much attention to Groundhog Day.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,

Urban babies
wear black.  Today you turn 13 months old, which means we have completed the first month of your second year of life. This means that for the past month, weâ€™ve been saying things like â€œOh, remember this time last yearâ€¦?â€ This time last year you were too small for the Halloween costume we had for you (a black cat), we barely noticed the change back to Standard Time, I was still getting the hang of feeding you, and Daddy and I spent the better part of the days in pajamas.</description>

      <description>No, this is not about some new software from Valve. Instead today is momentous for a different kind of half life. It was Halloween in 1988 that Carolyn and I started dating. For those of you not doing the math, that was 18 years ago. For those of you continuing to not do the math, or that don&amp;#8217;t know us that well, we were 18 at the time.
Carolyn and I have been some form of romantic partners to each other for half our lives (at least at the year-granular level&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;m not going to write a script like my friend to do the to-the-minute calculation.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,

She sure is cute  Do you hear that noise? Thatâ€™s your parents laughing and crying and jumping up and down because you turned ONE YEAR old, which means we MADE IT! We survived the first year, and here you are laughing, smiling, talking, and nearly walking. One full orbit around the sun and our newborn blob has become a little person with opinions and personality. Dad and I feel like we can finally breathe after 365 days of worry.</description>

      <description>My wife and I have been taking pictures of Sam pretty much whenever she and the camera are in the same room. Alas, the downtime means I have pictures on my internal file server, they have not yet made it up into the now woefully out of date gallery.accapehart.com. My little camera can also take short movies (as you might have seen with the blue angels post). Carolyn will be posting some of these in a new category she calls &amp;#8220;Channel Sam&amp;#8221; and the first of these is up now.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Iâ€™ve been writing this letter to you in mind for weeks now, but until now I havenâ€™t managed to spill the words onto a page. I hope youâ€™ll cut me a little slack, because, you know, in addition to everything else going on during your 11th month, there was the little matter of that CROSS-COUNTRY move. Oh yes. You began this month in Altoona, PA and ended it in El Cerrito, CA.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Iâ€™m writing this to you in your Uncle Johnâ€™s old room at Gradyville, PA. You are asleep in my old room, clutching a toy car and set of plastic keys. The knees of your purple pants are filthy, your feet are covered in carpet fuzz and cat fur, and your round little tummy rises and falls rhythmically, straining against the straps of the car seat you fell asleep in.</description>

      <description>There was a time when it was perfectly normal to set an alarm to wake Sam up to feed between 2 and 3AM. At the time, those days seemed eternal, stretching out for miles. The notion of sleeping through the night too dim to even imagine in the distance. And then, of course, things changed. Now I am all too happy to forget that old routine.

I have big shoes to fill (you can take that figuratively or literally, as you like, because yes, your daddy has big feet). Since your daddy spent this past month in California, it is up to me to provide the chronicle of your ninth month.
Nine months! Good lord, child, youâ€™ve now been out for as long as you were in. How did that happen? When I look at your impish smile and the light tripping in your eyes I can barely recall the tiny, sleepy newborn Sam that used to fit along the length of my arm from elbow to palm.</description>

      <description>Not that I needed another reminder about my &amp;#8220;semester abroad&amp;#8221; as Carolyn has referred to my extended absense from my family, but one struck home this morning. I dunno if you use Centrum as a multivitamin, but we do, and I&amp;#8217;ve always wondered why often you buy a big pack, and it&amp;#8217;s got this little travel-sized 30-vitamin container in the same package. Well, I did buy just such a package shortly after I arrived here, and this morning, I consumed the last vitamin from that 30-count container.</description>

      <description>Sammy Mammy here. Thanks to all those who sent us your sleep stories, ideas, and encouragement, here in the comments and elsewhere. We&amp;#8217;ve had a variable week. It still takes a while to get Sam to sleep at bedtime, but we&amp;#8217;ve had more success with her naps. One thing that seems to help is not letting her stay up longer than 2 hours at a time, in addition to watching for signs of sleepiness.</description>

      <description>Dear Readers of ChoicyWhiteBoy:
Help! Sammy Mammy here. Our darling baby Samantha does not want to go to sleep. Ever. Well, she sleeps pretty well between midnight and 6am, getting up once around 2am to eat. But we continue to have a devil of a time getting her to sleep. Nap irregularity during the day we can handle; however, the nightly bedtime battle is really getting to me.
We have been doing the same nightly routine (bath, book, breast) for over a month.</description>

In honor of Samâ€™s 10-week birthday, here are 10 Things I Love about Samantha:</description>
