      <description>I have two really smart friends who are building MailRank. I don&amp;#8217;t know more than they&amp;#8217;ve posted online or made inferences from their name, but I think they are trying to make email distinguish between the stuff you do care about (mail from your spouse) and stuff that&amp;#8217;s not spam, but you don&amp;#8217;t care about (mail from the bike shop, mail from your mom). If it works (and, to be sure, I&amp;#8217;ve got no idea how it possibly could), I&amp;#8217;d love to get a &amp;#8220;biff&amp;#8221; style notification of &amp;#8220;mail I do care about&amp;#8221;!</description>

      <description>Camping   &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; There&amp;amp;#8217;s something magic to camping. The quiet sounds of nature still louder than the faint hum of the distant city. The s&amp;amp;#8217;mores fire next to me radiating dwindling heat and light. The redwoods arcing overhead painting inky shadows against the sky lit with the glow of stars and the city both close and far. I&amp;amp;#8217;m glad to be sharing it with Sam who I hear tossing and turning in the tent, sleepless from the novelty.</description>

      <description>I went for a bit of a meander-y bike ride today. For a good bit of it, I was on San Pablo Ave (see map below.)
San Pablo Ave is 4 lanes of automotive traffic, and has occasional bike lanes. At one point I was honked at, presumably for not being &amp;#8220;in my place&amp;#8221; in the bike lane. I&amp;#8217;m not sure I was flipped off, but I sure was startled so just in case, I [I went for a bit of a meander-y bike ride today.</description>

      <description>I tweeted that I was going to drag myself outside today, and probably be glad I did. I did, and I was. I decided to go for a wander on my street bicycle. I&amp;#8217;d not gotten more than a couple hundred yards when I had a little trouble shifting, so I immediately turned around to diagnose with tools at home. I eventually decided that the support for Sam&amp;#8217;s sidecar was pinching the shifter cable.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;#8217;t really think of myself as an adrenaline junkie, but the way I&amp;#8217;m beaming at the moment may be betraying me. I just got back from a mountain bike ride. It was amazing (or if you&amp;#8217;re reading this from the UK, it was brilliant. Or if you&amp;#8217;re reading this on teh inter webz, it was teh awesome)!
The girls are away, there are trails nearby that I&amp;#8217;ve only begun to explore, I had no plans for the day, and because it&amp;#8217;s California, the weather was simply perfect.</description>

      <description>Maker Faire!   &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The three of us went to the Maker Faire ((Carolyn especially enjoyed the spelling of &amp;amp;#8220;Faire&amp;amp;#8221; as it&amp;amp;#8217;s the French infinitive of &amp;amp;#8220;to do&amp;amp;#8221; or &amp;amp;#8220;to make&amp;amp;#8221;! )) today. I was ambivalent about going originally as it seemed like it would be a bit of a hassle to get there. Originally, it was going to be only Sam and myself going, but as Carolyn helped us figure out how best to get there, she decided it looked interesting to her too, so we decided to all go.</description>

      <description>There are people in my life who, when they keep re-appearing, cause me to ask myself why. I can only assume it&amp;#8217;s because they have a lesson to teach me and I&amp;#8217;ve not learned it yet. I have to assume it&amp;#8217;s something about communication style with this individual. As Carolyn put it, &amp;#8220;Some geeks are cute. Their social awkwardness leading to a shyness that can be endearing. Others are just off-putting.</description>

      <description>I was riding my motorcycle to work the other day when I saw a service van that I thought was pretty funny and made me think of one of those joke vans they use on the Simsons to indicate that it&amp;#8217;s really a spy van trying not to be a spy van. Simpsons example:
 Flowers
By
Irene
 In this case, the van was emblazoned with a picture of a water heater and the company name &amp;#8220;Just Water Heaters, Inc.</description>

      <description>I guess this really has been a bay area weekend. Yesterday, we went down to Berkeley partly just to wander, partly to pick up a kid-sized table and chairs for Sam that Carolyn arranged to buy through BPN but partly to go to Half Price Books. We were seeking the third book in the Song of Fire and Ice series &amp;#8212; A Storm of Swords. I gave up on the series after the first book &amp;#8212; too much soap opera, too little fantasy, but it engulfed Carolyn like a raging storm (of swords?</description>

      <description>The past 3 weekends have all been wet in some way or another. I went sailing on the bay on a 30&amp;#8242; Hunter a few weeks ago. Last weekend, we went to a beach that&amp;#8217;s a 10-or-so minute drive pretty much due west of our house, and this weekend we went to the 36th annual NCMA boat show. It was great except that we got a late start so that we didn&amp;#8217;t get much time there before we had to come back for nap time.</description>

      <description>Last weekend, we were dining at our favorite local Thai restaurant and we had a seating neighbor who was fairly loud. Since we&amp;#8217;re north of Berkeley (and in the San Francisco area), the fact that she was &amp;#8220;naturally&amp;#8221; dressed and appeared to be on a date with her female companion went completely without note. That she was on an easily overheard and extended rant about her neighbor&amp;#8217;s behavior was a little bit annoying.</description>

      <description>People have complained (or admired) Apple computer for its effective product launches and getting a great deal of excitement about upcoming or just released products. This has not escaped the watchful eye of the onion. Probably a quarter of the people in my office already have the iPhone.
And yet truth is at least as strange as fiction as I saw this teaser at the top of another commuter&amp;#8217;s paper today: &amp;#8220;Apple ready to announce what&amp;#8217;s next.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure there&amp;#8217;s a name for this &amp;#8212; the discord between the name of something being an inaccurate description. You know several government examples like &amp;#8220;The clean air act&amp;#8221; or the &amp;#8220;defense department&amp;#8221;. Yesterday morning on my commute, I had a moment of disconnect until I realized that distinction again. I saw a van a lane or two over with a picture of the Golden Gate Bridge on it, and in big letters, &amp;#8220;Bridge Painters.</description>

      <description>We went to our second museum since Sam&amp;#8217;s birth today. And it was a much better experience than the previous time (in Princeton during Sam&amp;#8217;s first conference.) Sam lasted for a full 40 minutes or so at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA). They were having an exhibit of Picasso and American artists that he influenced. It was neat to see Picasso beside the artists the he inspired, whether direct derivations, or connected more tangentially.</description>

      <description>I hate when I&amp;#8217;m stopped for directions in San Fancisco. I&amp;#8217;ve not been in the area long, and I spend astonishingly little time in the city that isn&amp;#8217;t 1) in the office or 2) on the walk to/from BART/carpool.
I was stopped on the walking portion of my morning commute today by an older Hispanic man and his obviously embarrassed wife. He told me, in fairly unaccented English: &amp;#8220;I am looking for the office of Miglatude.</description>

      <description>I am reminded this weekend of why it is that we uprooted our lives and moved across the country.
For starters, weather. As I write this, it&amp;#8217;s 2-degrees F in Altoona. Here, it&amp;#8217;s 54-degrees F.
This weekend, we went to the Berkeley marina where we stumbled upon the Cal Sailing Club which I intend to join. Right there, there was also an adventure park which we did not yet explore and another playground where Sam stomped around in the sand, rode on the swings, and slid down the slide.</description>

      <description>When I was a member of City Car Share, before my wife, daughter, furniture and car came out to join me in the bay area, I got to drive a Prius around. It was kinda cool. It could be erily quiet at stop lights, it got up to highway speed well enough, if occasionally hesitant. But one of the things that amused me most about it was a sticker on the window.</description>

      <description>I often (though no longer &amp;#8220;frequently&amp;#8221;) take &amp;#8220;casual carpool&amp;#8221; (or creepy carpool as my co-workers call it). This is an amazing thing to me as it feels like something that can only happen in the bay area. There are places around the east bay where people and automobiles congregate to get across the bay bridge. The advantage for pedestrians is a free ride across the bridge over into the city. The advantage for the driver is that they get to go around the toll plaza, and use the carpool lane.</description>

Today in El Cerrito, CA was a high of 72 degrees F with a low of 49.</description>

      <description>There&amp;#8217;s been a little bit of activity on our home in Altoona. We have a contract with a contingency that the buyer needs to sell his home, and we just learned that he had a contract. While I&amp;#8217;m terribly excited that soon we won&amp;#8217;t be having to pay both rent and mortgage, and glad not to own a house that would otherwise sit unattended through a winter, I&amp;#8217;m still a little saddened by it.</description>

      <description>The Go-Kart racing. That was fun, but I&amp;#8217;m still sore. A bunch of Lindens went down to Burlingame, CA where we went to GoKart Racer Where you do the racing (I guess at other GoKart places, your mom does the racing?)
There were roughly 30 of us there for racing. The sign-in process wasn&amp;#8217;t bad, but was a little slow as we all had to go through a process for which there are a few computers, and of course we arrived as a bunch.</description>

      <description>It was with mixed emotions, (but mostly childlike-delight) that I got to watch the Blue Angels perform over the San Francisco bay near North Beach. The skill and training involved is amazing. The planes themselves are cool, and just seeing the turns they make, their proximity for some maneuvers, their separate coordination for others. It&amp;#8217;s a sight to see.
So, we had quite an afternoon. We drove in (the traffic was maddening) and parked at Linden Lab which was close enough to walk to the Fisherman&amp;#8217;s Wharf area from which we could get a pretty good view.</description>

      <description>Oh boy, oh boy. I love the opportunities afforded us by living in a &amp;#8216;real&amp;#8217; metropolitan area. This afternoon, a bunch of people from our company went Go-Kart racing. And this isn&amp;#8217;t your little neighborhood go-kart track either.. this was racing. With track-jump-suits, helmets, neck braces, and whipping around corners. (Are you sure you don&amp;#8217;t want to come work with us?!?) &amp;#8212; More on this soon, but suffice it to say, I brought home a trophy!</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A good friend of mine has (re-)entered the blog-o-sphere with a blog named &lt;a href=&#34;http://beauframe.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;beauframe&lt;/a&gt;. He starts with a subway story. I recommend you &lt;a href=&#34;http://beauframe.blogspot.com/2006/07/her-name-is-africa.html&#34;&gt;read it first&lt;/a&gt;. His telling of his experience reminded me to blog a somewhat related subway (BART) experience I had recently.&lt;/p&gt;
