      <description>Or &amp;#8220;How to proofread a job posting&amp;#8221;.
I came across this posting on the python group I&amp;#8217;m a member of on (in?) Linked In.
The first typo, was a bit awkward, but I could see how it would happen during an editing/revision session when that session wasn&amp;#8217;t followed by a proofreading. &amp;#8220;Our client is a leader in the worldwide leader&amp;#8221;. So, what you&amp;#8217;re saying is they lead?
But what actually cracked me up was the simple substitution of a &amp;#8220;t&amp;#8221; where a &amp;#8220;d&amp;#8221; should go.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure there&amp;#8217;s a name for this &amp;#8212; the discord between the name of something being an inaccurate description. You know several government examples like &amp;#8220;The clean air act&amp;#8221; or the &amp;#8220;defense department&amp;#8221;. Yesterday morning on my commute, I had a moment of disconnect until I realized that distinction again. I saw a van a lane or two over with a picture of the Golden Gate Bridge on it, and in big letters, &amp;#8220;Bridge Painters.</description>

      <description>The radio was an important part of my childhood. I was limited in the amount of (non-PBS) television I was allowed to watch, but there was no such limit on the radio. The 80&amp;#8217;s contained the complete range of my teen-hood, and I still have a fondness for &amp;#8217;80&amp;#8217;s music. Mostly my parents listened to NPR (WUNC &amp;#8211; Chapel Hill), so that was a big part of my childhood too. I have fond memories (to the point of idealized nostalgia) of listening to &amp;#8220;Prairie Home Companion&amp;#8221; by kerosene lantern after Saturday evening meals nestled in the &amp;#8220;shack&amp;#8221; in the mountain woods of Virginia.</description>

      <description>The theme for this week&amp;#8217;s Word-a-Day is interesting. It&amp;#8217;s all about the positive versions of words we always hear in the negative. Here are the introductory paragraphs from today&amp;#8217;s word (sipid):
 Why is there so much negativity around us? Open a newspaper, watch
TV, listen to the radio, and you find nothing but negative words.
Ever wonder why some words almost always appear in their negative
forms? It&amp;#8217;s completely evitable, as the words for the next five</description>

      <description>I enjoy puns, and wordplay, possibly to a fault. If I remember, I&amp;#8217;ll post some shaggy dogs at some point.
I read somewhere earlier today about someone sidling up to a bar, and that made me think about the word sidle.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#8217;s one of those words I only know from context, and that context is alwasy sidling up to a bar.&amp;nbsp; I inferred that the definition was just &amp;#8220;to approach&amp;#8221;, but I looked it up today to learn that it means to approach or move sideways (or furtively).</description>
