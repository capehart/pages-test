      <description>As a youth, living with my dad, we changed the oil together on the 1973 VW Beetle that became mine when I turned 16. So, it wasn&amp;#8217;t an unfamiliar concept. But I was long out of practice. Nonetheless, it was past due on my motorcycle and while I could just take it to the mechanic, I don&amp;#8217;t have a mechanic here I&amp;#8217;m totally in love with. So, with some encouragement from a friend, I decided to undertake it myself.</description>

      <description>Had a nice, if somewhat hot, day out motorcycling with Frank, formerly of Linden Lab, now of Aquarium of the Bay. Wandered the far east bay. Wound up again at Port Costa. Had drinks and a sandwich there. Watched trains and tankers and tugs. Talked. Thought. Threw rocks into the Carquinez Straight. Came back through Crockett (whence came &amp;#8220;The Rocket From Crockett&amp;#8220;) and got home around 6 PM.
The last leg was really interesting from a meteorological perspective.</description>

      <description>Head On
  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Well, I&amp;amp;#8217;d been hankering for some time. But tonight it became a reality. I purchased my 4th motorcycle. (No, I still don&amp;amp;#8217;t have the other three. I&amp;amp;#8217;ve only had one at a time, I&amp;amp;#8217;m no Jay Leno.) This one is just a little less crotch-rocket than I&amp;amp;#8217;d owned before. It still has zip, but it&amp;amp;#8217;s just a little more dignified, and a lot more comfortable. When I took it for an inaugural spin around the block, it was strikingly familiar.</description>

      <title>Motorcycling Fate</title>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m going to tempt fate again. Carolyn (wisely) suggested &amp;#8220;Why don&amp;#8217;t you write it offline first?&amp;#8221; And that really was a good suggestion. Only, I like to tempt fate &amp;#8212; at least with small things that don&amp;#8217;t really matter. And while I&amp;#8217;d like to tell you about my motorcycling, It&amp;#8217;s hardly really important. So, here I am again; in the blogger window, writing about motorcycling.

(For those of you who are wondering what the fuck is he talking about?</description>

      <description>(with apologies to Wallace &amp;amp; Gromit for the title.)
Today was my birthday, though I pretty much used the whole weekend to celebrate.
Yesterday, I borrowed a motorcycle from a friend of a friend (how cool is that!?!) and went for a motorcycle ride with about 8 others in a motley collection of motorcycles (only 2 were even from the same manufacturer!). We headed south from Altoona along twisty back roads and found ourselves (with a little bit of searching) at the Road Kill Caf&amp;eacute;.</description>
