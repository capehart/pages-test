      <description>Or &amp;#8220;How to proofread a job posting&amp;#8221;.
I came across this posting on the python group I&amp;#8217;m a member of on (in?) Linked In.
The first typo, was a bit awkward, but I could see how it would happen during an editing/revision session when that session wasn&amp;#8217;t followed by a proofreading. &amp;#8220;Our client is a leader in the worldwide leader&amp;#8221;. So, what you&amp;#8217;re saying is they lead?
But what actually cracked me up was the simple substitution of a &amp;#8220;t&amp;#8221; where a &amp;#8220;d&amp;#8221; should go.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;#8217;t count how many times I have looked on the back of a photograph hoping the photographer wrote down who those people are, or when or where the photo was taken. Well, it would actually be a fairly small number, but boy is it annoying when you want the data and it just isn&amp;#8217;t there. Digital cameras will almost always automatically embed date information for you (and if not, then the software you pick them up with will!</description>

      <description>Because of the Second Life reference, I was pointed at this Boston Globe post.
I was amused by the following juxtaposition:
 &amp;#8230;there will be greater access to government, with online services to let anyone question members of the president&amp;#8217;s Cabinet or track every dime of the federal budget.
 &amp;#8230;
 Judging by the campaign&amp;#8217;s position paper on technology policy &amp;#8211; calls and e-mails to the Obama transition team were not returned &amp;#8211; the president-elect believes&amp;#8230;</description>

      <description>There are people in my life who, when they keep re-appearing, cause me to ask myself why. I can only assume it&amp;#8217;s because they have a lesson to teach me and I&amp;#8217;ve not learned it yet. I have to assume it&amp;#8217;s something about communication style with this individual. As Carolyn put it, &amp;#8220;Some geeks are cute. Their social awkwardness leading to a shyness that can be endearing. Others are just off-putting.</description>

      <description>Sam has been exploring what it means to be alive. We tell her trees are alive, but rocks aren&amp;#8217;t. Flowers are alive, but cars aren&amp;#8217;t. I&amp;#8217;ve been using growth as a proxy for life when Sam asks &amp;#8220;Why aren&amp;#8217;t cars alive?&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Are trucks alive?&amp;#8221;
We were going through some of this today eating out on the patio of &amp;#8220;House of Curries&amp;#8221; on Solano Ave in Berkeley (or is it still Albany there?</description>

      <description>I was riding my motorcycle to work the other day when I saw a service van that I thought was pretty funny and made me think of one of those joke vans they use on the Simsons to indicate that it&amp;#8217;s really a spy van trying not to be a spy van. Simpsons example:
 Flowers
By
Irene
 In this case, the van was emblazoned with a picture of a water heater and the company name &amp;#8220;Just Water Heaters, Inc.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been mentioning Sam&amp;#8217;s stories recently. Mom just read Sam a draft of another children&amp;#8217;s story, and now Sam is &amp;#8220;writing&amp;#8221; and telling stories. The most recent one is something about how when Mommy was a little girl and Sam was a bigger girl and there was a fox in the woods and we made it to the top of big rock candy mountain. (She&amp;#8217;s also been listening to the soundtrack of &amp;#8220;O Brother, Where Art Thou?</description>

      <description>Overheard today as Sam saw me go into the home office to get my stuff together to go into the office today:
 Mommy, I have to do some work today {pause} on the computer.
 No doubt b/c of yesterday. She threw a mini-fit at dinner time because it was time to wash hands instead of continuing to play with alphababy.</description>

      <description>As a preface to this post, it&amp;#8217;s important to understand that Sam still doesn&amp;#8217;t enunciate very clearly. She can&amp;#8217;t properly create all the phonemes in the English language. Sam&amp;#8217;s babysitter was impressed with how much Sam talked, but bemoaned how little she could understand of what Sam was saying. We&amp;#8217;re pretty good at making it out. After all, we&amp;#8217;ve been listening to her since she was born! Anyway, words like &amp;#8220;Turtle&amp;#8221; don&amp;#8217;t yet sound like &amp;#8220;turtle&amp;#8221; It&amp;#8217;s more like &amp;#8220;tor lul&amp;#8221;.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s funny to me how apt a name Camus was for our cat. While perhaps only in stereotype was our cat an absurdest existentialist cat. He hardly qualified as warm and friendly. Really, if you imagine a cat named Camus, you&amp;#8217;d probably be pretty spot-on.
But he wasn&amp;#8217;t always called Camus. When I first met him, his name was &amp;#8220;Match.&amp;#8221; I don&amp;#8217;t know what, exactly, inspired me to give Carolyn a cat for her birthday in 1995.</description>

      <description>I was trying to get Sam down for her nap today. She was tired enough, but is still a bit cranky as she attempts to get over a tummy bug. I asked which pajamas she wanted, and she had decided &amp;#8220;polka dots&amp;#8221; (which have feet in them.) So, to put those on we took her socks off. She decided she wanted to keep her socks on so asked for &amp;#8220;monkies&amp;#8221; which don&amp;#8217;t have feet.</description>

      <description>This quote came through email recently in the office:
 &amp;#8220;You know what itâ€™s like. Youâ€™re chatting to your robot friend whilst skydiving from a floating marshmallow castle when you realise youâ€™re late for work.&amp;#8221;
 The broader email was about the launch of Vodafone in Second Life. 🙂</description>

      <description>This link made the rounds at work today. I shared it with bk and Carolyn, my only (semi-)regular non-Linden workday correspondents, and Carolyn suggested I blog it. I won&amp;#8217;t steal the thunder from the article to recreate it here, but it&amp;#8217;s a short read and reasonably insightful if perhaps a little over-broad. It&amp;#8217;s about the &amp;#8220;tact filter&amp;#8221; and its orientation between nerds and &amp;#8220;normal&amp;#8221; people. [[In an age where people have &amp;#8216;(re)claimed&amp;#8217; geekness to the point where &amp;#8216;athletics geek&amp;#8217; is no longer a completely laughable oxymoron, is there such a thing as a &amp;#8216;normal&amp;#8217; person?</description>

      <description>People have complained (or admired) Apple computer for its effective product launches and getting a great deal of excitement about upcoming or just released products. This has not escaped the watchful eye of the onion. Probably a quarter of the people in my office already have the iPhone.
And yet truth is at least as strange as fiction as I saw this teaser at the top of another commuter&amp;#8217;s paper today: &amp;#8220;Apple ready to announce what&amp;#8217;s next.</description>

      <description>When I was a member of City Car Share, before my wife, daughter, furniture and car came out to join me in the bay area, I got to drive a Prius around. It was kinda cool. It could be erily quiet at stop lights, it got up to highway speed well enough, if occasionally hesitant. But one of the things that amused me most about it was a sticker on the window.</description>

      <description>One of the things the I like about being back in a small technology company is the feeling of being more &amp;#8220;in the loop&amp;#8221; for various (memes?) (cultural references?). While I doubt either of these qualify as memes, they both pleased me enough in some way to want to share them with you:
 &amp;#8220;Spock Casa&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; An impressively animated feature of Spock showing off his crib. (1 min) Boten Anna &amp;#8212; Basshunter&amp;#8217;s song about a man who falls in love with an IRC bot.</description>

      <description>As you may recall, we had some trouble picking Sam&amp;#8217;s name. While I love my daughter Sam, her name still seems a little random. We wanted something relatively unique, but still not so uncommon as to be a source of teasing, or misunderstanding. The latter was the major strike against Ana&amp;iuml;s &amp;#8212; a name both Carolyn and I like. Alas, the uniqueness was also called into question when within a month of her birth, I received an email from another Samantha Capehart!</description>

      <description>There are plenty of What&amp;#8217;s your [insert topic] name? memes running around &amp;#8212; we even did these before we had the internet to do them with. At the time, the memes (though we didn&amp;#8217;t call them that) were the specific rules that made up your name. For example your soap opera name was made up of your first pet followed by street you grew up on. My soap opera character was the androgynous Buffy Green.</description>

      <description>So, sharing videos is not exactly a meme, but I&amp;#8217;ve happened to come across a few recently that I quite enjoyed, though the entire collection below is likely to be interesting only to someone with my particular collection of interests:
 Homemade lightsaber movie (really good): &amp;#8220;http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=672422470842718521&amp;amp;q=ryan+dorkman&amp;amp;#8221;:http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=672422470842718521&amp;amp;q=ryan+dorkman

 Will Wright talks about the really fascinating new game spore: &amp;#8220;http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8372603330420559198&amp;amp;q=spore&amp;amp;#8221;:http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8372603330420559198&amp;amp;q=spore (see also the &amp;#8220;game&amp;#8217;s homepage&amp;#8221;:http://www.spore.com/)

      <description>Steelers Girl  There&amp;#8217;s a skit on Chappelle&amp;#8217;s Show where Dave Chappelle buys a crazy camera from a mysterious dealer. That camera has special powers including seeing the person&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;inner self.&amp;#8221; We went to visit some friends recently, taking Sam along. It appears that our friend must have purchased the same crazy camera as Dave Chappelle because after our visit, he sent us this picture that he took while we were there.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;#8217;t want to do a blog category on marketing genius, but I&amp;#8217;m afraid it&amp;#8217;s come up again here.
Partly because we have a good friend who&amp;#8217;s a P&amp;amp;G baby, partly because P&amp;amp;G supports Upromise, but mostly (and I really do mean mostly) because it&amp;#8217;s cheap, we buy &amp;#8220;Joy&amp;#8220;dishwashing liquid.
First off, I think &amp;#8220;Joy&amp;#8221; is an odd name for dishwashing liquid. Expecting a chuckle of support and a comment like &amp;#8220;Yeah, why don&amp;#8217;t they call it &amp;#8216;kleenzgud&amp;#8217;?</description>

      <description>I told Carolyn&amp;#8217;s voicemail the story of the forgotten wallet, and was therefore positively ebullient when she came home from work with two bags of Doritos. In snacking on these, I happened to read a little bit of the packaging. According to the bag, &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s the only snack bold enough to call itself Doritos &amp;reg; brand.&amp;#8221;
Well, yeah. Any other snack that was &amp;#8220;bold enough&amp;#8221; to call itself Doritos would have the pants sued off of them by Frito Lay.</description>

      <description>Maybe I just have a dirty mind, but it took me a moment too long to parse this correctly when I heard it the first time:
&amp;#8220;OK, It&amp;#8217;s time for floor play. Do you want to touch your turtle? Here. Touch your turtle.&amp;#8221;
&amp;#8212; Sam touches her turtle.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s been a while since I&amp;#8217;ve stumbled across something on the web that made me chuckle quite like &amp;#8220;stuff on my cat&amp;#8221;. I was looking for new themes for wordpress, because when I get stuck on what I&amp;#8217;m working on, it&amp;#8217;s easier to fantasize about how my blog could look than fix whatever is stumping me at the moment. One link lead to another lead to stuff on my cat. Of course, they claim to be mentioned in GQ and several other magazines, so it&amp;#8217;s hardly a discovery.</description>

      <description>For reasons that I won&amp;#8217;t go into here (If you&amp;#8217;re lucky, maybe I&amp;#8217;ll tell you later. If you&amp;#8217;re really lucky, maybe you can guess.) I Googled on &amp;#8220;PBF NSFW&amp;#8221;. (OK, Actually, I A9&amp;#8217;ed. I like saving money at Amazon). Anyway, the first link was just PBF archive. I went. I saw that &amp;#8220;PBF&amp;#8221; stood for &amp;#8220;Perry Bible Fellowship&amp;#8221;, and I stopped right there. After all, I had just done a Google (and yes, this time I mean Google) blogsearch on Altoona, and found the top entry was the Altoona First Southern Baptist Church Men&amp;#8217;s Ministry Blog.</description>

      <description>I meant to post this on the second instead of almost a week later. So, I&amp;#8217;m going to back-date this one. Maybe you&amp;#8217;ll see it, maybe not. Anyway, Gary Larson&amp;#8217;s The Far Side is probably my second-favorite comic strip ever (behind Bill Waterson&amp;#8217;sCalvin and Hobbes). During my junior year of college, I was an RA, and already pretty well acknowledged as a gamer much more than a studier. When this particular strip came out (10/15/90 apparently), some people thought it might resonate with me.</description>
