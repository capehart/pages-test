      <description>My wife already blogged the Salsa Cat story. But I&amp;#8217;ve been amazed at Sam&amp;#8217;s story-re-telling ability. She&amp;#8217;ll &amp;#8220;read&amp;#8221; books almost word for word that we&amp;#8217;ve read to her. Sure, we&amp;#8217;ve read them a lot, but not enough for us to be able to recite them. Anyway, here Sam is re-telling the Salsa Cat story.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s funny to me how apt a name Camus was for our cat. While perhaps only in stereotype was our cat an absurdest existentialist cat. He hardly qualified as warm and friendly. Really, if you imagine a cat named Camus, you&amp;#8217;d probably be pretty spot-on.
But he wasn&amp;#8217;t always called Camus. When I first met him, his name was &amp;#8220;Match.&amp;#8221; I don&amp;#8217;t know what, exactly, inspired me to give Carolyn a cat for her birthday in 1995.</description>

      <description>We euthanized our cat, Camus, today. It seems such a strange way to say it. But easier than &amp;#8220;we took a family member to be killed today.&amp;#8221;
Camus resting  I guess it had been coming for a while. A long while, really. He&amp;#8217;d had feline mega colon for years. Mostly we&amp;#8217;d managed it medically, giving him 4 different medications ((cisapride, lactulose, mineral oil and metamucil)) twice daily. Still, cleaning up errant poop or vomit wasn&amp;#8217;t an uncommon occurrence.</description>
