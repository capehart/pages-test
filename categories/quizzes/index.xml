      <description>I&amp;#8217;m not exactly sure why my wife wanted me to take this quiz, much less post it. But she wanted both, so here it is. I&amp;#8217;d say that about the only thing interesting about it is that I grew up in the south, and both of my parents have stronger southern accents than I do. My mom is from the midwest though, and Durham is a rather cultured city at least compared to stereotypes of the south ðŸ™‚</description>

      <description>The only surprise for me is that the Nebuchadnezzar isn&amp;#8217;t any higher.
      You scored as Serenity (Firefly). You like to live your own way and don&amp;#8217;t enjoy when anyone but a friend tries to tell you should do different. Now if only the Reavers would quit trying to skin you.

      <description>Reviewing links on Choicy White Boy, I noticed that there&amp;#8217;s a link to the blog of the Author of the WordPress Theme I&amp;#8217;m using (journalized-winter). I checked it out, and saw that he had a &amp;#8220;nerd score&amp;#8221; of 92. Pretty nerdy, I thought. So, I took the quiz. I should learn not to take quizes. In other online quizes, I learned that I was a satanist, who my &amp;#8220;inner rock star&amp;#8221; was (Chris Isaac?</description>

      <description>I don&amp;#8217;t know why I take these quizzes really. Does it matter to me to know who my inner rock star is? Or how well I stack up against my peers in my successful distinction between there, they&amp;#8217;re and their? Still, I saw a quiz that asked which (witch? ðŸ˜‰ religion was right for me, and I took it.
I am amused to announce that I&amp;#8217;m a Satanist. I wonder if there&amp;#8217;s a checkbox for that on PSU&amp;#8217;s equal opportunity employment form somewhere.</description>
