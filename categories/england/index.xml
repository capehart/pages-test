      <description>Sunday. We weren&amp;#8217;t really sure what we wanted to do today, but we had talked about doing one of the &amp;#8220;bus to bus&amp;#8221; walks in Brighton where you could take a bus to one of the stops and then do a country walk in the Sussex downs to somewhere else that a bus runs, and catch that back into town. As a family, we&amp;#8217;d done the Ditchling Beacon to Devil&amp;#8217;s Dyke walk once.</description>

      <description>Saturday, we awoke late after a mixed night&amp;#8217;s sleep. We ate our breakfast procured from Waitrose the day before. Yogurt and blueberries for myself while Sam and Carolyn had Muffins with Bonne Mammon, clementines and milk. We confirmed that trains to Lewes were frequent and headed up to the station. We got our tickets there and boarded a Southern &amp;#8220;local&amp;#8221; train with a few stops before we even got to Lewes.</description>

      <description>Alas, there was no day 1 post, so this will have to suffice for both, at least for now.
I wish I were more observant about the mundane, because in some important ways, I think it&amp;#8217;s the mudane that matters far more than the extrordinary. At least in story telling.
We left Philadelphia Thursday evening. We flew from the international terminal at PHL on USAirways. We were originally supposed to fly from A6 at one end of the terminal, and shortly after we settled down there, an announcement came over the PA that there was a gate change and we needed to switch to A23 at the other end of the terminal.</description>

      <title>Outing Weekend</title>

      <description>Saturday: Ditchling Beacon to Devil&amp;#8217;s Dyke (route) (photos)
Sunday: Lewes Castle to Brighton (route) (photos)
Originally, this weekend, we had planned to train up to Gatwick and from there to take a trail along to Pooh Corner and the Hundred acre woods. We had that queued up for Sunday so decided to go for a walk on Saturday. Only we slept in on Sunday because Saturday&amp;#8217;s walk tired us out, so we gave up Pooh Corner in favor of Lewes Castle.</description>

      <description>No, not diabolical lesbians, but instead a valley (and surrounding hillside) that&amp;#8217;s part of the South Downs in Sussex, not far north of Brighton and Hove. Now maintained by the National Trust. Carolyn, Sam and I had an outing there after a late Sunday breakfast. We hiked around, had a picnic lunch, and I got some kite flying in. I was worried that I was going to have packed my kite for nothing, but already I&amp;#8217;ve flown both days this weekend.</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;re doing some cleaning up getting ready to go to England and I see a crumpled (from travel) piece of paper on my desk&amp;#8230; It&amp;#8217;s the tasting chart from scotchbuddy.com as I was part of this tasting group.
Rather than continue to live with a crumpled piece of paper on my desk, I&amp;#8217;m going to preserve the results in my blog where you can refer to it in case you ever wish to buy me scotch.</description>
