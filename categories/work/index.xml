      <description>I can&amp;#8217;t believe it&amp;#8217;s been nearly a quarter since my last update. Certainly, I&amp;#8217;ve been keeping pretty busy. Singing Horse Studio is doing well, and starting to get as much work as we can handle. We now need to work on managing our growth. Another tricky area for a young business &amp;mdash; actually for ANY business. We&amp;#8217;ve expanded into the USA having successfully registered with the Virginia State Corporation Comission on July 1st, 2011.</description>

      <description>I came across an interesting &amp;#8220;installation&amp;#8221; today at MIT. I think someone I follow tweeted it. It was interesting to me how it categorized my presence. The big bars were &amp;#8220;online&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;management&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;education&amp;#8221;. &amp;#8220;sports&amp;#8221; is bigger than it has any right to be. It was interesting to see some of the things it grabbed. References to me from former professors, test emails to lists I set up while at IATH, my &amp;#8220;temporary&amp;#8221; home page.</description>

      <description>I woke from a weird dream this morning. A new colleague (who doesn&amp;#8217;t really exist) was objecting to some work that I wanted to do that would leverage the cloud and improve the user experience because it would &amp;#8220;cause more workload.&amp;#8221; Some time later, we&amp;#8217;re at a webdev meeting and I realize I&amp;#8217;m the supervisor of all these people and the team is so large it&amp;#8217;s unwieldy. Someone higher up in the organization is talking to us about something that&amp;#8217;s not particularly engaging.</description>
