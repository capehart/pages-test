      <description>About 20 years ago, my grandfather &amp;#8220;(Grand) Pop&amp;#8221; died. I still remember packing up his model trains with my dad and some of the rest of the family. The specific bit of his legacy for me. They hadn&amp;#8217;t been unpacked since. Instead, they followed me from place to place still in the boxes we packed back then. For the past several years, they were stored with the inlaws who recently kindly suggested that maybe it was time for them to come home.</description>

      <description>As we&amp;#8217;re getting ready to leave this place, I&amp;#8217;m occasionally hit by waves of nostalgia. I had a moment tonight as I looked out over the landscape from our front stoop. Off and on while we were in this house, Sam and I would get to spend some time together just before we started the night time ritual where we&amp;#8217;d &amp;#8220;look at the darkness&amp;#8221;. And we&amp;#8217;d been doing it off-and-on even from the point of her early language development so it evolved from &amp;#8220;I look ah dark?</description>

      <description>Camping   &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; There&amp;amp;#8217;s something magic to camping. The quiet sounds of nature still louder than the faint hum of the distant city. The s&amp;amp;#8217;mores fire next to me radiating dwindling heat and light. The redwoods arcing overhead painting inky shadows against the sky lit with the glow of stars and the city both close and far. I&amp;amp;#8217;m glad to be sharing it with Sam who I hear tossing and turning in the tent, sleepless from the novelty.</description>

      <description>In an effort to preserve the artifacts of childhood without the artifacts of childhood, Carolyn and I have been trying to preserve Sam&amp;#8217;s efforts digitally.
The Poem   &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; I came home after work one day recently, and at some point in the evening, out of the blue, Sam says: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; &amp;amp;#8220;I wrote you a poem daddy. I left it on your bedside table. You can read it when you go to bed.</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;ve been making an &amp;#8220;outgoing&amp;#8221; chart to help Sam, in social situations, to be more, well, social. She&amp;#8217;s been doing a good job, and recently completed said chart so as a reward, we&amp;#8217;re going to Fairyland in Oakland. This morning, we were talking about the day and she said she was going to go as a fairy. Because it&amp;#8217;s fairy land. Mom asked what Mom and Dad should go as.</description>

      <description>Sam got her first &amp;#8220;bicycle&amp;#8221; today. We got her a &amp;#8220;balance bike&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;walking bike&amp;#8221;. We&amp;#8217;d looked around and found some pretty good deals on amazon, but we wanted to try it out in the shop before making a purchase like that. So we went to a few different bike shops including Performance that didn&amp;#8217;t have any. We wound up at &amp;#8220;Mike&amp;#8217;s Bikes&amp;#8221; where they had a few from Specialized. Sam was really cute as she skuut&amp;#8217;ed around the store on it, making &amp;#8220;ch&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;ch&amp;#8221; sounds.</description>

      <description>Sam and I were looking at a map of the UK and Ireland and I asked if she knew who comes from Ireland? She didn&amp;#8217;t know that that&amp;#8217;s where her (great-)aunt Janet is from, so we talked about that. She asked where her (great-)aunt Scotties is from, and I said &amp;#8220;Richmond, where Grand-mÃ¨re lives now.&amp;#8221; The following conversation ensued:
 Sam: Daddy, I&amp;#8217;ve got a new country coming.
Dad: Oh? What&amp;#8217;s the name of the new country?</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been mentioning Sam&amp;#8217;s stories recently. Mom just read Sam a draft of another children&amp;#8217;s story, and now Sam is &amp;#8220;writing&amp;#8221; and telling stories. The most recent one is something about how when Mommy was a little girl and Sam was a bigger girl and there was a fox in the woods and we made it to the top of big rock candy mountain. (She&amp;#8217;s also been listening to the soundtrack of &amp;#8220;O Brother, Where Art Thou?</description>

      <description>Overheard today as Sam saw me go into the home office to get my stuff together to go into the office today:
 Mommy, I have to do some work today {pause} on the computer.
 No doubt b/c of yesterday. She threw a mini-fit at dinner time because it was time to wash hands instead of continuing to play with alphababy.</description>

      <description>Well, OK, she didn&amp;#8217;t write her name by herself today. This morning, we practiced together with pen and paper. I tried to get her to hold the pen &amp;#8220;properly&amp;#8221; but didn&amp;#8217;t get far with that. Her &amp;#8216;S&amp;#8217; looked like something between a &amp;#8220;d&amp;#8221; and a squared-off &amp;#8220;o&amp;#8221;. But later in the afternoon, I set her down in front of AlphaBaby, and I pointed out some of the letters, drew her name with stars, etc.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Iâ€™m writing this to you on my 38th birthday. This morning when I got you up out of your crib, you asked, â€œWhat day is today?â€ I replied, â€œMonday.â€ Then you said, â€œItâ€™s Mommyâ€™s birthday! Happy Birthday, Mommy!â€ And you gave me a hug.
Best. Birthday. Present. Ever.
A few hours later, we were running errands on foot and you wanted me to carry you, and I was already lugging two bags of groceries, and you wouldnâ€™t wear your sun hat, and you kept telling me to take mine off, and you cried and complained for the last two blocks.</description>

      <description>Dear Sammy,
For your newsletter describing your 30th month of life, Iâ€™ve been collecting phrases that weâ€™ve heard around the house. These are the ones that make your Dad and me grin, or gasp, or sometimes grimace. But in each case, we look at each other and mouth â€œdid she just say that?â€
Here you go. Soundbites from a 2Â½ year-old girl:
â€œMommies donâ€™t go to work. Daddies do.â€
â€œIâ€™m not a big girl yet.</description>

      <description>As a preface to this post, it&amp;#8217;s important to understand that Sam still doesn&amp;#8217;t enunciate very clearly. She can&amp;#8217;t properly create all the phonemes in the English language. Sam&amp;#8217;s babysitter was impressed with how much Sam talked, but bemoaned how little she could understand of what Sam was saying. We&amp;#8217;re pretty good at making it out. After all, we&amp;#8217;ve been listening to her since she was born! Anyway, words like &amp;#8220;Turtle&amp;#8221; don&amp;#8217;t yet sound like &amp;#8220;turtle&amp;#8221; It&amp;#8217;s more like &amp;#8220;tor lul&amp;#8221;.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
I&amp;#8217;m not sure where to start for this month. I suppose all months are continuations of the previous, but that seems especially true this month. Probably because it took me getting half way through this month before finally abdicating last month&amp;#8217;s newsletter to your mother. Regardless, this month was full of growth and change for you. Mom indicates that you&amp;#8217;ve been &amp;#8220;speaking in paragraphs&amp;#8221; for some time now. I&amp;#8217;m not really sure how or when that happened, but you do string together related sentences.</description>

      <description>Dear Sammy,
Dad and I are a few weeks late with this newsletter. You (and the people we share this letter with) will have to forgive us: your 28th month was a difficult oneâ€”not because of you, but because this past month saw the death of a longtime family member: our beloved kitty Camus.
Iâ€™m going to start there. He died near the end of the month, but his death has colored the entire month.</description>

      <description>My wife already blogged the Salsa Cat story. But I&amp;#8217;ve been amazed at Sam&amp;#8217;s story-re-telling ability. She&amp;#8217;ll &amp;#8220;read&amp;#8221; books almost word for word that we&amp;#8217;ve read to her. Sure, we&amp;#8217;ve read them a lot, but not enough for us to be able to recite them. Anyway, here Sam is re-telling the Salsa Cat story.</description>

      <description>I suppose it shouldn&amp;#8217;t come as a surprise that a reporter would have a blog. Nor that &amp;#8220;Santa Al&amp;#8221; would make a blog-worthy impression. Still, it&amp;#8217;s a bit of a trip to run across. OK, I didn&amp;#8217;t really &amp;#8220;run across&amp;#8221; it &amp;#8212; he forwarded it to me. But there you go. A reporter got caught up in my dad&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;alternate reality&amp;#8221; field. Maybe that&amp;#8217;s why I&amp;#8217;ve been into virtual worlds for so long; I&amp;#8217;m just trying to recreate my childhood.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Well, Chrissum time is over. Alas, by the end you were saying &amp;#8220;Christmas&amp;#8221; about as often as you said Crissum. Your little approximations of words are cute and fleeting. Already I miss getting to hear the babble of your baby talk and wish I&amp;#8217;d found a way to record more of it. This month has begun a real inquisitive phase for you. You have a hard time being adjacent to a conversation without saying something like &amp;#8220;What&amp;#8217;s mommy and daddy talking about?</description>

Sam: No, I sat in my car seat. He sat next to me. And a birdie sat next to me.
Dad: Isn&amp;#8217;t a blue jay a type of bird?

      <description>I was trying to get Sam down for her nap today. She was tired enough, but is still a bit cranky as she attempts to get over a tummy bug. I asked which pajamas she wanted, and she had decided &amp;#8220;polka dots&amp;#8221; (which have feet in them.) So, to put those on we took her socks off. She decided she wanted to keep her socks on so asked for &amp;#8220;monkies&amp;#8221; which don&amp;#8217;t have feet.</description>

      <description>&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s Crissum Time!&amp;#8221; Dear Sam,
Before you came into our lives, I knew, and almost certainly used, the phrase &amp;#8220;childlike delight,&amp;#8221; but I really don&amp;#8217;t think I had the visceral sense of the meaning of that phrase until you showed up to demonstrate it for me. You love looking at people&amp;#8217;s Christmas lights (Crissum lights) &amp;#8212; including our own. You&amp;#8217;ve even interrupted whatever play was going on at the time to simply call out, in case anyone forgot, that &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s Crissum time!</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
When I put you down for your afternoon nap just now, you sang along to your bedtime song â€œSamantha, fais dodo.â€ I was trying not to smile too hard, because, you knowâ€¦ itâ€™s nap time and you have a hard enough time as it is settling down to rest. When we finished the song, you exclaimed â€œSammy did it!â€ After I left the room, you reprised the song, and then added a few rounds of â€œFrÃ¨re Jacques,â€ followed by a rousing rendition of â€œPop Goes the Weasel.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Well, it&amp;#8217;s not quite month 25 yet, but this is certainly the latest I&amp;#8217;ve been for a while. It&amp;#8217;s going to be hard not to talk about where you are now, but to restrict it to where you were then. Even though then and now are only a few weeks apart!
I guess let&amp;#8217;s start with linguistic development. Impressive as usual. You have a large nursery rhyme book that you enjoy.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
It&amp;#8217;s been a quarter of a year since I last wrote your newsletter! Thank goodness Mom stepped up to the plate. She also saved my butt this month as I have a &amp;#8220;notes&amp;#8221; email from her containing what could be considered &amp;#8220;talking points&amp;#8221; for this newsletter. Two thing really stand out for me in particular this month though:
1) Jumping and Skipping. You really enjoy both of them. You also enjoy requesting them of me.</description>

      <description>At SIGGRAPH, one of the area chiefs for the Guerilla Studio raved about Flock, so I thought I&amp;#8217;d try it out.&amp;nbsp; This is a post initiated from within Flock on the &amp;#8220;Post to my blog&amp;#8221; button.
Also, a little Sam update.&amp;nbsp; Today, she did two new slides by herself at the playground at Canyon Oak Trail.&amp;nbsp; One tall and twisty, the other shorter but steep and enclosed, aka &amp;#8220;the tunnel.&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp; Previously, she&amp;#8217;d refused to do this without holding someone&amp;#8217;s hand and since neither is at all conducive to hand-holding, she&amp;#8217;d simply not done either before.</description>

      <description>Dear Sammy,
Daddy was going to write your letter this month, but since a) heâ€™s sick, and b) heâ€™s working for SIGGRAPH at San Diego this week, and c) youâ€™re giving me a nice long nap this afternoon, I decided that I would start it.
So, hi Sammy! Happy 22 months old! Youâ€™re two months away from two years old. Technically. In practical terms, youâ€™re right smack dab in the middle of the Terrible Twoâ€™s.</description>

      <description>Dear Sammy,
I have a lot to tell you about this past month, but first let me tell you a little anecdote that has completely charmed your father and me. We still end your day with a reading of Time for Bed (by Mem Fox)â€”a little story book we received when you were born. Weâ€™ve been reading it to you since you were about 4 months old. Each page has a little rhyme about a parent animal telling the baby animal that itâ€™s time for sleep.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Wow. What a month. It is a real pleasure when your mom takes one of the monthly newsletters because it helps me recharge and get more energy and enthusiasm for writing. This month is a pleasure to write not just because of that break though. So much has happened in the past month, I barely know where to begin.
I guess I want to start with your verbal development, as despite everything else, that has what has impressed me so consistantly this month.</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;ve had a potty in the bathroom for a few weeks now. We give her praise for sitting on it, but mostly ignore it. We&amp;#8217;ve sat her on it in a way she could actually make use of it a few times before, but nothing&amp;#8217;s come of it. Today on the way to the bath (she traverses the house naked from the living room to the bathroom,) she asked for the potty and went to sit on it.</description>

      <description>We went to our second museum since Sam&amp;#8217;s birth today. And it was a much better experience than the previous time (in Princeton during Sam&amp;#8217;s first conference.) Sam lasted for a full 40 minutes or so at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA). They were having an exhibit of Picasso and American artists that he influenced. It was neat to see Picasso beside the artists the he inspired, whether direct derivations, or connected more tangentially.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Do you have anything in your life that you&amp;#8217;re (almost) always glad that you&amp;#8217;ve done, you usually enjoy doing, but you dislike (or just have a hard time) starting? I have several of these. Working out is one of them. I have a hard time getting from the house to the front door of the gym. Once I&amp;#8217;m through the doors, I usually enjoy myself, and when I&amp;#8217;m done a workout, I rarely regret having been.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Some of the other moms that brings kids to your tot group remarked, &amp;#8220;Oooh, 17 months, that&amp;#8217;s a rough age.&amp;#8221; If that&amp;#8217;s the case, I can&amp;#8217;t wait to see a great age, because you&amp;#8217;ve been a real pleasure to be around this month. It&amp;#8217;s true that you&amp;#8217;re starting to explore this thing we call a tantrum, but the ones I&amp;#8217;ve been exposed to have been pretty managable, and we&amp;#8217;ve gotten you out of them without too much trouble.</description>

      <description>The radio was an important part of my childhood. I was limited in the amount of (non-PBS) television I was allowed to watch, but there was no such limit on the radio. The 80&amp;#8217;s contained the complete range of my teen-hood, and I still have a fondness for &amp;#8217;80&amp;#8217;s music. Mostly my parents listened to NPR (WUNC &amp;#8211; Chapel Hill), so that was a big part of my childhood too. I have fond memories (to the point of idealized nostalgia) of listening to &amp;#8220;Prairie Home Companion&amp;#8221; by kerosene lantern after Saturday evening meals nestled in the &amp;#8220;shack&amp;#8221; in the mountain woods of Virginia.</description>

      <description>Dear Samantha,
Tomorrow you will turn 16 months old. Back in Pennsylvania, a little groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil will stick his little brown nose out of his hole-in-the-dirt house and venture out into the air. Hundreds of people will watch to see if he sees his shadow. If he does, folklore has it that there will be six more weeks of winter. If not, there will be an early spring. I was saying to your Dad the other day that I doubt people in the San Francisco Bay area pay much attention to Groundhog Day.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Already it&amp;#8217;s been almost a month and a half, since I&amp;#8217;ve written your newsletter. Yet, in some ways it seems to me like I just wrote your month 14 newsletter. I&amp;#8217;ll be fascinated to see how both of us have a changing perception of time as we both mature. I remember as a child ((I was about to write &amp;#8216;kid&amp;#8217; here, but then remembered that as a kid, I wouldn&amp;#8217;t let anyone refer to me as &amp;#8216;kid&amp;#8217; because it (also) meant &amp;#8216;baby goat.</description>

Last week, Mom and Sam came into the city so that Mom could get some new glasses. Sam and I had lunch in a park near the office. A passerby noted &amp;#8220;You two look like such a picture there.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
It&amp;#8217;s been a while since I (Dad) have written your monthly newsletter. I&amp;#8217;ve been fortunate that your mom has been willing to take up the challenge during the time that I was out in California without you guys, and during your transition out here. But I&amp;#8217;m back (and with a new interface on the blog) and do I get a great month to write about.

      <description>It may come as a shock to some readers to know that my mom has re-married. I know it would have come as a shock to me had she not called me a few days before to let me know that they&amp;#8217;d decided to do it. That announcement was the shocker.
Both she and her beau (I mean husband) Tom enjoyed each other&amp;#8217;s company and they&amp;#8217;d been together for a while, but they had also both exclaimed their intent never to re-marry.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,

Urban babies
wear black.  Today you turn 13 months old, which means we have completed the first month of your second year of life. This means that for the past month, weâ€™ve been saying things like â€œOh, remember this time last yearâ€¦?â€ This time last year you were too small for the Halloween costume we had for you (a black cat), we barely noticed the change back to Standard Time, I was still getting the hang of feeding you, and Daddy and I spent the better part of the days in pajamas.</description>

      <description>No, this is not about some new software from Valve. Instead today is momentous for a different kind of half life. It was Halloween in 1988 that Carolyn and I started dating. For those of you not doing the math, that was 18 years ago. For those of you continuing to not do the math, or that don&amp;#8217;t know us that well, we were 18 at the time.
Carolyn and I have been some form of romantic partners to each other for half our lives (at least at the year-granular level&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;m not going to write a script like my friend to do the to-the-minute calculation.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,

She sure is cute  Do you hear that noise? Thatâ€™s your parents laughing and crying and jumping up and down because you turned ONE YEAR old, which means we MADE IT! We survived the first year, and here you are laughing, smiling, talking, and nearly walking. One full orbit around the sun and our newborn blob has become a little person with opinions and personality. Dad and I feel like we can finally breathe after 365 days of worry.</description>

      <description>My wife and I have been taking pictures of Sam pretty much whenever she and the camera are in the same room. Alas, the downtime means I have pictures on my internal file server, they have not yet made it up into the now woefully out of date gallery.accapehart.com. My little camera can also take short movies (as you might have seen with the blue angels post). Carolyn will be posting some of these in a new category she calls &amp;#8220;Channel Sam&amp;#8221; and the first of these is up now.</description>

      <description>MonsterFool has already blogged about Sam&amp;#8217;s well-baby visit. But I wanted to include a couple of things that she didn&amp;#8217;t.
1) The pediatrician gave Sam a book &amp;mdash;Rainforest Colors. We were so uncertain that this was really the case, we had to ask at the nurses station on the way out to be sure. They grinned, and confirmed &amp;mdash; every well baby visit from 12-months on, you get a book when you go to the doctor&amp;#8217;s.</description>

      <description>It was a year ago now, that Samantha Fay Capehart came into the world. I&amp;#8217;m amazed at all that&amp;#8217;s happened in the past year &amp;#8212; so many changes in our lives. I&amp;#8217;ll try to wax poetic about them soon, but in the meanwhile, I wanted to wish you a
Happy Birthday, Samantha!</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Iâ€™ve been writing this letter to you in mind for weeks now, but until now I havenâ€™t managed to spill the words onto a page. I hope youâ€™ll cut me a little slack, because, you know, in addition to everything else going on during your 11th month, there was the little matter of that CROSS-COUNTRY move. Oh yes. You began this month in Altoona, PA and ended it in El Cerrito, CA.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Iâ€™m writing this to you in your Uncle Johnâ€™s old room at Gradyville, PA. You are asleep in my old room, clutching a toy car and set of plastic keys. The knees of your purple pants are filthy, your feet are covered in carpet fuzz and cat fur, and your round little tummy rises and falls rhythmically, straining against the straps of the car seat you fell asleep in.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m back in PA with my family. So nice to see them. It drives home my impatience for the resolution of this whole transition though.
I&amp;#8217;m not quite back to my former status with Sam, but I was clearly no stranger either.
The things that struck me most about her after having been gone for almost 2 months:
 Larger: Project Fatbaby has been largely successful.
 More alert: Actually attentive to things rather than just responsive to stimuli</description>

      <description>There was a time when it was perfectly normal to set an alarm to wake Sam up to feed between 2 and 3AM. At the time, those days seemed eternal, stretching out for miles. The notion of sleeping through the night too dim to even imagine in the distance. And then, of course, things changed. Now I am all too happy to forget that old routine.
Here&amp;#8217;s our current routine at Mom-mom and Granddaddy&amp;#8217;s:</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
I have big shoes to fill (you can take that figuratively or literally, as you like, because yes, your daddy has big feet). Since your daddy spent this past month in California, it is up to me to provide the chronicle of your ninth month.
Nine months! Good lord, child, youâ€™ve now been out for as long as you were in. How did that happen? When I look at your impish smile and the light tripping in your eyes I can barely recall the tiny, sleepy newborn Sam that used to fit along the length of my arm from elbow to palm.</description>

      <description>Not that I needed another reminder about my &amp;#8220;semester abroad&amp;#8221; as Carolyn has referred to my extended absense from my family, but one struck home this morning. I dunno if you use Centrum as a multivitamin, but we do, and I&amp;#8217;ve always wondered why often you buy a big pack, and it&amp;#8217;s got this little travel-sized 30-vitamin container in the same package. Well, I did buy just such a package shortly after I arrived here, and this morning, I consumed the last vitamin from that 30-count container.</description>

      <description>My dearest Samantha,
As I start writing this, I&amp;#8217;m on an airplane flying away from you. We&amp;#8217;ll be separated for weeks. Alas, as I look this over for posting, it&amp;#8217;s already almost three weeks later. The job, and the housing search have been consuming my time. I had heard reports from a couple of people who had been out of work for a while about how long the days seemed when they finally were back in the 9-5 workforce.</description>

 Thursday, I received a certified letter from the IRS containing a Notice of Deficiency which has to be cleared up in 90 days.
 The relo company &amp;#8212; which has had my approximate schedule for some time now &amp;#8212; now needs 3 weeks advance notice before having a surveyor come walk through the house and tell them how much it will cost to move us. Because it&amp;#8217;s summer.</description>

      <description>I think it was yesterday, maybe it was the day before &amp;#8212; time gets so lost right now &amp;#8212; when Sam made the half of the (stereo-)typical baby noise. She said &amp;#8220;Ga&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; Now all we need is a &amp;#8220;Goo&amp;#8221; to go with it, and we&amp;#8217;ll be set!
Also, people are coming tomorrow to see the house! It&amp;#8217;s still not in great shape, but mostly it&amp;#8217;s just clutter. I&amp;#8217;ve finished the work I want to do to it (mostly thanks to the family helping out last weekend.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Wow. Another month whipped by. I can&amp;#8217;t believe how quickly it feels like April went. Of course, for you, it was one seventh of your life, and for me it was about one three hundred and fortieth, so we&amp;#8217;re bound to have at least slightly different takes on it. That said, looking back, your mom and I still managed to come up with a number of things regarding your development that we think noteworthy.</description>

      <description>OK, so this is kind of a Sam post. But since two of these happened today, I thought they should go up.
Real Baby?
Who can tell?  Carolyn and I were walking toward the post office. I was carrying Sam in the baby bj&amp;ouml;rn, and an older woman in one of those golfcart/wheelchair hybrids rolled along toward us. She stopped her cart to ask, in amazement, &amp;#8220;Is that a real baby?</description>

I&amp;#8217;m stuck seeking part 2 of the virtual lives thing, and I didn&amp;#8217;t want to interrupt the flow. But, oh well. Sam rocks. She came to watch me play soccer this evening. It&amp;#8217;s so great to have her and mom there. Unfortunately, they are usually ready to go before I am, and since I bring the soccer ball and the cones, when I leave, the party&amp;#8217;s over.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,

Cute Sam  When I started this, &amp;#8220;monthly&amp;#8221; seemed like the right time frame. In fact, it seemed a little aggressive. Thinking about my own life, it seems that little actually changes month-to-month. Maybe my vocabulary increased by 1 word (this month, it was papabile), maybe I put on a pound, (or took if off if I was lucky). I was worried that I&amp;#8217;d have nothing to say about your growth.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve got a number of unwritten posts in my head. (Albeit a small number.) Still, I wanted to get this one up now because it&amp;#8217;s just too cute.

Sam at Play  The website she&amp;#8217;s playing at is kneebouncers.com which I first wrote about here. She still doesn&amp;#8217;t have the responsive nature of it down. She pretty much mashes the keyboard and watches the screen, but I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure she knows that it reacts to her.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m in San Francisco tonight on business. It&amp;#8217;s the first night in my daughter&amp;#8217;s life that we&amp;#8217;ve not slept in the same room. It feels a little odd to be this out of touch &amp;#8212; the flight landed here after I hope both wife and daughter were well asleep.
I&amp;#8217;m in the &amp;#8220;Dirty Harry&amp;#8221; room of the Hotel Bijou. It&amp;#8217;s kinda cool in a funky, downtown-y way. I don&amp;#8217;t know if I&amp;#8217;m exactly in the red light district, but I&amp;#8217;m certainly not in the upscale neighborhood judging by the adult dvd mega stores, and the bars on the windows.</description>

      <description>Sorry I&amp;#8217;ve been so quiet recently. I actually have a few things to say, but have been having trouble focusing on this. Partly because of busy (baby still = handful, + clients, etc.), also because there&amp;#8217;s some stuff going on that I can&amp;#8217;t blog yet. I hate when that happens because I feel like it blocks up the rest of my creativity as well.
Anyway, the only real reason for this entry is to mention that there are a bunch of new pictures up of the world&amp;#8217;s cutest baby.</description>

      <description>Sammy Mammy here. Thanks to all those who sent us your sleep stories, ideas, and encouragement, here in the comments and elsewhere. We&amp;#8217;ve had a variable week. It still takes a while to get Sam to sleep at bedtime, but we&amp;#8217;ve had more success with her naps. One thing that seems to help is not letting her stay up longer than 2 hours at a time, in addition to watching for signs of sleepiness.</description>

      <description>Dear Readers of ChoicyWhiteBoy:
Help! Sammy Mammy here. Our darling baby Samantha does not want to go to sleep. Ever. Well, she sleeps pretty well between midnight and 6am, getting up once around 2am to eat. But we continue to have a devil of a time getting her to sleep. Nap irregularity during the day we can handle; however, the nightly bedtime battle is really getting to me.
We have been doing the same nightly routine (bath, book, breast) for over a month.</description>

      <description>Samantha,
I&amp;#8217;m just about ready to stop apologizing for the fact that your monthly newsletter, while coming out every month, does not, in fact, come out on (or even very close to) your actual, specific birthday. I&amp;#8217;m a more sporadic blogger than I&amp;#8217;d like to be, and your newsletter suffers somewhat for that fact. Nonetheless, it&amp;#8217;s here now, and I&amp;#8217;m pleased to report that your fifth month was once again a banner month for you.</description>

      <description>As I think I mentioned in reporting on Sam&amp;#8217;s most recent pediatric visit, we&amp;#8217;ve learned that now is the time to be helping Sam develop good sleep habits. Everything we&amp;#8217;ve heard is that infants and children do best with routine and that a good bed time ritual can really help the whole household. The child knows what to expect. It ends in sleep, so the whole house is calmer, happier. It&amp;#8217;s all good.</description>

      <description>Steelers Girl  There&amp;#8217;s a skit on Chappelle&amp;#8217;s Show where Dave Chappelle buys a crazy camera from a mysterious dealer. That camera has special powers including seeing the person&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;inner self.&amp;#8221; We went to visit some friends recently, taking Sam along. It appears that our friend must have purchased the same crazy camera as Dave Chappelle because after our visit, he sent us this picture that he took while we were there.</description>

      <description>When my wife and I became new parents, we took advantage of a coupon included with Boppy and subscribed to Parents magazine. I&amp;#8217;ve found some of it useful, but some of it atrocious.
Among the slightly irritating:
 The &amp;#8220;Goody Bag&amp;#8221; included &amp;#8220;binky bling&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; a $35. &amp;#8220;jewel&amp;#8221;-encrusted pacifier and the information that &amp;#8220;Hip moms clip sparkly Binkies to their diaper bags long after their babies outgrow the habit.&amp;#8221; Also in the goody bag: boots that Jennifer Garner &amp;amp; Ben Affleck bought for Violet.</description>

      <description>When I was growing up, I didn&amp;#8217;t have to worry about what my parents wrote about me. Neither of them wrote much. OK, my mom&amp;#8217;s great about letters and cards, and my dad&amp;#8217;s pretty good about postcards from key locations, or travel events. And I know my mom journals. But that kind of communication is, I think, fundamentally different from the public forum of blogging. As I continue to be a daddy blogger, I pay attention to others of the same ilk.</description>

      <description>I realized today as I was feeding Sam that there were worries that I&amp;#8217;d had when she was younger that I no longer have.
I took a moment to revel in them.
 Breathing &amp;#8212; OK, we aren&amp;#8217;t out of the woods entirely for SIDS at this age, but we&amp;#8217;re past most of the serious danger area. When Sam was a few weeks old, I remember waking up in the night, and not being able to hear her breathe.</description>

      <description>We did it. And it was at least a moderate success. Sam had her first non-milk, non-formula food today! We mixed up some rice cereal with formula, and fed it to her with a spoon. A real (baby) spoon! It&amp;#8217;s hard to tell how much she actually took, as a great deal of it landed on her bib, her clothes, her parents, her chair, her floor, etc. (Not really all that bad.</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;ve taken some grief recently over SamTrak. People seem to think it&amp;#8217;s a bit beyond the pale to be tracking Sam&amp;#8217;s feeding and elimination habits on the Internet. But, there is reason to my madness. Because of her size, we needed to track feeding and elimination. Because it&amp;#8217;s me, it seemed easiest to do this online (access from any computer instead of &amp;#8220;Where&amp;#8217;s the little black poop notebook?&amp;#8221;). Now, I could have done it on my private house-network, but then Carolyn couldn&amp;#8217;t have accessed the information from work.</description>

      <description>Sam had her 4-month checkup at the pediatrician last Thursday, and in addition to shots, got a clean bill of health. Her percentiles are generally up as well, and she has a good weight &amp;#8220;velocity.&amp;#8221; This means that a lot of changes are starting now.
 We&amp;#8217;ll be able to start giving her solids as soon as we like. We need to start setting good bedtime habits and establish a bedtime routine.</description>

      <description>When Mom was away at work, Dad declared that it was time for a fashion shoot. Unfortunately, Dad was so lazy, he didn&amp;#8217;t even go upstairs to get a white sheet as a backdrop, making do, instead, with a few gauzy cloth diapers. It didn&amp;#8217;t come too well, but it&amp;#8217;ll just have to do. So, here you go. Altoona&amp;#8217;s youngest calendar girl is now also a fashion model &amp;#8212; showing off all (well, some) of the 0-3 month styles before she outgrows them.</description>

      <description>Cutest. Baby. Ever.
  Well, Sam, I&amp;#8217;m off to a late start again, but I&amp;#8217;ve not forgotten your newsletter. As in previous months, a lot has changed this month. Highlighting these changes has been your basic physical shape. I&amp;#8217;ve been facinated by reviewing pictures from previous months. Dr. Karp (The Happiest Baby on the Block) talks about the first three months as the &amp;#8220;fourth trimester&amp;#8221; and it was certainly a reasonable description for you.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m sure that&amp;#8217;s something you&amp;#8217;ve been thinking for some time now. After all, college is just 16-19 years away for darling Samantha. (She might go early, she might take a year off &amp;#8212; She hasn&amp;#8217;t made her preference clear to me yet.) And college is not getting any cheaper. Thanks to some generous donations over the past few years from Grandm&amp;egrave;re and Great-Grandmother Ruth, Sam has a start at a 529 plan college fund.</description>

      <description>We had our &amp;#8220;Class Reunion&amp;#8221; for our Bradley Method Birth class today. It was neat to get together. We&amp;#8217;d actually run across the baby (and dad) from the other couple a day or two ago, but we&amp;#8217;d not seen the Bradley instructor since class, and it was nice to be in a more casual setting (their house).
The babies seemed at best mildly interested in one another. The other baby did spend a reasonable amount of time looking at Sam, but Sam was more interested in looking at Mom.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, Sam got another birth card. This one (ostensibly) came from Governor Ed Rendell, and his wife, Midge. The front looks like a normal congratulatory card. The cover says &amp;#8220;Welcome Little One&amp;#8221; and on the inside, &amp;#8220;The world is one baby sweeter now.&amp;#8221; And then comes the &amp;#8220;personal&amp;#8221; message from Midge &amp;amp; Ed. In handwriting-font, it says &amp;#8220;As parents, we know how precious your baby is to you. Keeping your little one healthy means starting immunizations by two months of age.</description>

I picked up Pop-pop from the Altoona train station after pretty much an all-day Amtrak trip from Richmond, VA. At least the price was right &amp;#8212; less than he&amp;#8217;d have paid in gas to make the drive. In a sense, he met Sam at a good time.</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;#8217;t track the first time she did this, but it&amp;#8217;s also of note that Sam has supported her own weight on her legs, and has been doing so for at least a week. She&amp;#8217;ll &amp;#8220;stand&amp;#8221; up in our laps. I can hold her just above her waist, helping with core balance a little, but she can do all of the standing herself. I think if she just weren&amp;#8217;t so top-heavy with her head, she could probably stand briefly on her own.</description>

      <description>Sam rolled over twice today from the much-despised tummy time on to her back. She is 15 weeks old today. I went to get the camera to capture the third time, but there was no third time. Instead, I recorded a couple minutes of a child fussing because she didn&amp;#8217;t want to have to lift that heave head one more time. Or, maybe it was performance anxiety.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s curious, though I guess not surprising, that becoming a father has given me some insight into my own childhood and my relationship to my father. A few things are starting to make a little more sense.
The first among these is bear hugs. I&amp;#8217;ve been getting bear hugs from my dad for as long as I can remember. I always kind of figured it was an &amp;#8220;alpha male&amp;#8221; thing. He was showing me that he was big and strong, and I&amp;#8217;d better keep in line.</description>

One of the things that we did today before our early-afternoon nap was to go for a walk. It was a beautiful day (for January) here, and I&amp;#8217;ve been noticing the lack of exercise brought about by the combination of having an infant at home and crappy weather outside.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,

Once again, I find myself writing your monthly newsletter well past the end of your month. I have a little bit better excuse this month &amp;#8212; we were traveling back from Mom-mom and Granddaddy&amp;#8217;s on the day you turned 3 months old. This trip was interestingly exhausting and recharging for me. You didn&amp;#8217;t seem to care much one way or the other, except you seemed to like some of the music you heard while you were there.</description>

      <description>We were actually willing to entertain folks a little while before we left for the holidays, but I never got around to blogging it. Afternoons are best. Please email (or call) to schedule a visit, and give us a call a little before you come over to make sure we&amp;#8217;ve not accidentally just set the house on fire. If you&amp;#8217;re sick, or think you might be, please postpone your visit. She&amp;#8217;ll still be an infant next week too, and we&amp;#8217;ll all be a much happier family if she&amp;#8217;s a well infant next week.</description>

      <description>After YEARS of absolutely HATING when my fine dining experience was RUINED by the piercing, spine-crawling wailing of someone else&amp;#8217;s infant, we braved being the culprits tonight. For the first time since Sam was born, we went out to eat. Not only that, we went out with the in-laws. We went to &amp;#8220;Yang Ming&amp;#8221; in Bryn Mawr &amp;#8212; one of the finer Chinese restaurants in the Philadelphia area.
In the past, we&amp;#8217;ve had a good experience there.</description>

      <description>Sam had her first travel of note yesterday. We went from Altoona to the Philadelphia area to start our holiday time with Mom-mom and Grand daddy. It&amp;#8217;s about a 4 hour drive. It took us until about 3:30 PM to finish packing up. The timing of getting an infant packed up to travel is tough because we wanted to do so much for her last minute. Change the diaper just before we leave, feed her just before we leave, etc.</description>

      <title>Rock your baby to sleep</title>

      <description>Yesterday afternoon/evening we rocked Sam to sleep. This was a little bit of a surprise. We knew that babies liked to be rocked, but we didn&amp;#8217;t realize that it was true for both the sway gently side to side definition AND the play or dance to rock &amp;#8216;n&amp;#8217; roll definition.
In this case, the three of us were dancing to Apache Indian&amp;#8217;s Boom Shack-a-lak when she konked out. A few of my dance &amp;#8220;moves&amp;#8221; startled her awake &amp;#8212; they would scare most anybody &amp;#8212; but she would drift right back to a contented sleep.</description>

      <description>Carolyn and I have started talking about what Christmas &amp;#8220;traditions&amp;#8221; we should start to institute. For that matter, we&amp;#8217;re also talking about how to present Christmas to baby Sam in the future. In many ways, despite the efforts of some true believers, Christmas has become as much a secular holiday as a religious one. As has been noted earlier, I&amp;#8217;m hardly a model Christian, despite agreeing with many of the stated (if not demonstrated) tenets of the faith.</description>

      <description>I just love moments like the one we just had. Sam had finished nursing recently, and I was holding her in the crook of my arm, her tiny body across my chest and belly. She looked up at me and exercised various facial muscles, including sticking her tongue out. A brief fuss storm washed over her, at the end of which, she had the good sense to close her eyes. She quickly fell asleep in my arms.</description>

      <description>No, it&amp;#8217;s not my high school locker combination. It&amp;#8217;s my daughter&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;percentiles&amp;#8221;. We had a visit to the pediatrician today, and among other things, Sam got some measurements taken. At 8lbs, 13 oz, she&amp;#8217;s in the fifth percentile for kids her age (~2.5 months). At 21.5 inches long, her length (height?) is in the 15th percentile. I&amp;#8217;ve forgotten what the raw data for her head circumference is, but it is in the 25th percentile.</description>

      <description>If I&amp;#8217;ve seen the movie, the Exorcist, it was a long time ago. As Carolyn will attest, I don&amp;#8217;t have a head for movies. But some movies are cultural references as much as they are movies and the Exorcist is famous for the kid&amp;#8217;s head spinning around 360 degrees.
Sometimes, I&amp;#8217;m afraid that&amp;#8217;s just what Sam&amp;#8217;s head is about to do. We read somewhere that &amp;#8220;80% of babies prefer to look to the right.</description>

      <description>I now have a new category &amp;#8212; Baby Metrics. It&amp;#8217;s where I&amp;#8217;ll be putting up summary information of the raw data contained in SamTrak. I&amp;#8217;m currently using charting software just for the diaper activity. I&amp;#8217;m undecided on it. It creates Flash graphs, which are pretty cool, but still rub me the wrong way. Maybe for no good reason. I was looking for a gd-based graphing tool and found jpgraph which seemed pretty neat.</description>

      <description>A while ago I asked AC if I could occasionally write a guest post on his blog, as I donâ€™t have time to properly maintain a blog of my own. (Even as I write this now, I should be sleeping!) He was kind enough to set it up so that I too can share my impressions of Sam.
In honor of Samâ€™s 10-week birthday, here are 10 Things I Love about Samantha:</description>

      <description>Some days, I&amp;#8217;m just not sure I can do it any more. Take this afternoon, for example. When I got up, mom was kinda short with me. When I asked what was going on, she said that she just needed some time to herself, she was weary and frustrated. I gather it was a rough morning. So, I sent her to Wal*Mart on one of the busiest shopping days of the year to buy diapers and other essentials.</description>

      <description>Today marks the end of using the SNS as a feeding method for Sam. We started it to try to minimize nipple confusion, but still get Sam the calories she needed. At this point, we&amp;#8217;re pretty much resigned to continued use of the nipple shield for as long as Sam breastfeeds. This is pretty frustrating, but our various attempts at weaning her from the shield have been fruitless so far.</description>

      <description>Keeping with the &amp;#8220;it sounds religious, but isn&amp;#8217;t&amp;#8221; theme for today, I thought I&amp;#8217;d mention our Baby Bj&amp;ouml;rn. We&amp;#8217;d heard good things about it, so put it on Sam&amp;#8217;s baby registry, and then promptly bought it for ourselves, because it looked too good to do without. Sam recently gained enough weight that she&amp;#8217;s now above the minimum weight for this thing, so we tried it out today. We got the regular size instead of the extra long thinking that Carolyn would be wearing her, but now we think that may have been a bit silly.</description>

      <description>No, in this case, I&amp;#8217;m not talking about the BVM that so permeates Altoona. I&amp;#8217;m talking about the latest way to calm a crying baby. I think I mentioned in the most recent monthly newsletter that she likes when we dance to music. I tried Madonna. She loved it. She calmed immediately. I wonder how much this will embarrass her in the future?
And am I pleased or sad that this may embarrass her in the future?</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been meaning to write about this first one for a while. In the early days of Sam, we received a lot of stuff. We&amp;#8217;re (Carolyn&amp;#8217;s) gradually making it through our thank-you note list, but one thing remains a mystery. And a fairly significant one too. We received a rocking chair. It was shortly after both Pop-pop and a family friend named &amp;#8220;Jo&amp;#8221; said they&amp;#8217;d send gifts, but gifts from each of them came the same day or shortly thereafter.</description>

      <description>Samantha,
Imagine if you will: You&amp;#8217;re on a TGV or Bullet Train. You&amp;#8217;re traveling through snowy, mountainous countryside. As you speed along, you pass through regularly spaced tunnels each a little bit longer and closer than the previous. As a result, it&amp;#8217;s alternately light and dark, and you hear a bit of a whoosh sound as you make each transition. That&amp;#8217;s what this past month has been like for me.</description>

      <description>Babies like to suck. Babies need to suck if they want to go on living. We&amp;#8217;ve decided not to give Sam a pacifier because, like so much in parenting, there&amp;#8217;s a wealth of information about it, but very little agreement. Good: It can calm the baby. Bad: It can interfere with breastfeeding. Good: It can help reduce the risk of SIDS. Bad: It can be a hard habit to break. Good: Unlike thumbs, it can be taken away.</description>

      <description>h2. What they have in common
 When she wants to be fed, she wants to be fed now, and she&amp;#8217;ll keep telling you that until you feed her.
 She hates having her claws clipped.
 Pooping is an any time any where sort of event.
 She like to fall asleep leaning on daddy.
 She naps like it&amp;#8217;s going out of style.
 She loves being where it&amp;#8217;s warm.</description>

      <description>Sam has begun vocalizations that aren&amp;#8217;t cries. For the most part, they are simply cry-parts vocalized outside of a period of fussyness. So instead of saying &amp;#8220;waaannnh&amp;#8221;, she&amp;#8217;ll bust out with just the occasional &amp;#8220;aannh&amp;#8221;. She&amp;#8217;s made a few others though. Being careful not to project interpretations of French professor mommy and gamer daddy, we&amp;#8217;re pretty sure she wants to go to Arles(pronounced &amp;#8220;aahrl&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s in France) where she will play GURPS(pronounced a lot like a hiccup &amp;#8212; presumably 4th edition).</description>

      <description>As we&amp;#8217;re approaching the 6-week-old threshold, it&amp;#8217;s becoming time to introduce the bottle to Sam so that I can feed her while Ca&amp;#8217;s back at work. In so doing, we&amp;#8217;re trying to figure out what nipple to use for the bottles. We want one that&amp;#8217;s least likely to cause &amp;#8220;nipple confusion&amp;#8221; wherein the baby decides that food comes from bottle nipples and starts rejecting the mom-based kind. Therefore, Carolyn is doing nipple research on the Internet.</description>

      <description>Newborns get all kinds of screens. One of the ones I had been insisting on was the one for Cystic Fibrosis (CF) &amp;#8212; I had an aunt die of CF, and so statistically, I had a pretty good chance to be a CF carrier. When the pediatrician said that we&amp;#8217;d get the CF screen at the one month checkup, I thought that she meant that they&amp;#8217;d take the blood for the screen then.</description>

      <description>Dear Samantha,
As I write you this first of monthly newsletters, you are asleep in my lap. One of your arms is raised straight up in the air, fingers spread wide, with your index finger slightly forward of the rest of the arc of your fingers. If I could reach the camera without disturbing your rest, I&amp;#8217;d definitely be preserving this for posterity. I enjoy how you still don&amp;#8217;t quite understand that the various parts of your body belong to you, and while there are ways in which I&amp;#8217;m very much looking forward to your maturation, I will miss this phase.</description>

      <description>We took Sam to the pediatrician today for her weekly weight check. We were hoping that she&amp;#8217;d have followed the instructions and gained 7 ounces in the past 7 days. Doing so would have brought her up to 6 pounds, 3 ounces. Instead, she was 6 pounds, 4.4 oz! So, we&amp;#8217;re going to keep doing whatever it is we&amp;#8217;ve been doing at least until we go back to the doctor&amp;#8217;s for her one-month check up next Monday.</description>

      <description>Sam is 4 weeks old today, but other than that, I don&amp;#8217;t have a lot to say about her. She continues to eat, sleep, poop and pee. Sometimes she&amp;#8217;s relaxed and engaged. Sometimes, she&amp;#8217;s inconsolably cranky. In the tradition of Heather Armstrong, I will start a monthly journal &amp;#8212; a newsletter to Sam, but that won&amp;#8217;t come out for another couple of days &amp;#8212; on her one month birthday.
Mom and dad are starting to get into a little more of a routine, but there&amp;#8217;s still not enough sleep to go around.</description>

      <description>We went back to the pediatrician&amp;#8217;s office today. I think I may have mentioned earlier that Sam&amp;#8217;s supposed to be gaining an ounce a day at this stage of life. So, she should have gained 7 ounces since we were last there. She gained 3.1. She&amp;#8217;s now at 5lbs, 11 oz. We&amp;#8217;ve been told to increase the frequency of the supplements &amp;#8212; We&amp;#8217;d been doing 2 a day. We&amp;#8217;re now going for 3-4.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve had some pretty good birthdays. Even this year, I had one that I really enjoyed. But, already, Sam has topped me. Just yesterday, 3 more packages came for Sam from such unlikely sources as the parents of my best friend from mid-late youth, and an administrative assistant that we rarely deal with any more from the campus. The outpouring has been amazing. Thank you. If you&amp;#8217;re still thinking to join in on the give Sam stuff parade, I have just one request &amp;#8212; no more &amp;#8220;Goodnight Moon.</description>

      <description>Well, Grand-m&amp;egrave;re left early afternoon today, right after breakfast. Yeah, you read that right. What of it? Now we&amp;#8217;re out of biological grandmothers. OK, Sam has one more grandmother (my dad&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;new&amp;#8221; wife). She&amp;#8217;s been part of my dad&amp;#8217;s life for years and years, but she still doesn&amp;#8217;t really feel like family the same way to me. No offense meant, just that Carolyn and I each had mothers during our childhoods, neither of which she was.</description>

      <description>We went to the pediatrician yesterday for a weight check. She did pretty good. Last time we were there, she was 5lbs, 3.9 oz. (birth weight was 5lbs, 3.5oz). This time, she was 5lbs, 8.6oz. Apparently, the rule of thumb for this phase of life is &amp;#8220;an ounce a day.&amp;#8221; 4.7 ounces was apparently close enough for 5 days. We&amp;#8217;re still a little stressed about her weight gain though. As I think I mentioned, we&amp;#8217;re supplementing her intake with formula, and we increased the quantity some in the last few days to make sure she&amp;#8217;s growing.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve heard from a couple of people now that they&amp;#8217;ve had trouble accessing Samantha&amp;#8217;s website, or SamTrak from her site. I suspect DNS trouble. I set these sorts of things up with some regularity, so I should have a pretty good idea of what to do. Alas, I usually do it on more sleep than I had recently, so I could have screwed something up. It all works for me, but I use my own DNS servers.</description>

      <description>They say that the poop of newborn, breast fed babies looks like mustard (complete with seeds), and on good days, that&amp;#8217;s proving true. (Bad days, it&amp;#8217;s greener and wetter, but you didn&amp;#8217;t really want to know that, now did you?) They also say that it changes parents&amp;#8217; view of mustard at least during this phase of development. For me, it&amp;#8217;s been mostly the other way. Instead of thinking that I have a jar of baby poop labeled &amp;#8220;Dijon&amp;#8221; in my refrigerator, I think &amp;#8220;Cool, my baby poops fine French mustard!</description>

      <description>You might think that since Grand-m&amp;egrave;re is a formal French title, that it might have something to do with Mom&amp;#8217;s side of the family. After all, Mom studies all sorts of things French. And while neither side of the family stands greatly on formality, you&amp;#8217;ll find fewer fart jokes told around the dinner table with Mom&amp;#8217;s side of the family. But no, you&amp;#8217;d be mistaken. OK, it&amp;#8217;s not much of a fairy tale, but here&amp;#8217;s the story of how Grand-m&amp;egrave;re got her name.</description>

      <description>We met with a different pediatrician today (same office). I was worried about Sam&amp;#8217;s wheezing &amp;#8212; especially as I was just getting over a cold myself. It turned out to be nothing but regular snot, but I&amp;#8217;m so glad we went. We had a much easier time communicating with this pediatrician than we did for Sam&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;regular&amp;#8221; doctor. While her regular doctor has a fine command of English (though it&amp;#8217;s not her native tongue), we don&amp;#8217;t feel like she listens to us and our questions particularly well.</description>

      <description>We made it from one grandmother to the next. Phew. Already Grand-m&amp;egrave;re&amp;#8217;s been a big help. She&amp;#8217;s returned a book to the library that would have been late tomorrow, she&amp;#8217;s gone to the grocery store and she&amp;#8217;s helping get the nursery prepped for the Trading Spaces style event down the road. This was a good thing because I hadn&amp;#8217;t even been in that room for most of a month. The windows were open because, it had been summer not that long ago.</description>

      <description>Mom-mom left this morning. And while my life isn&amp;#8217;t really one Simpsons reference after another, it feels a little bit like the &amp;#8220;Sherry Bobbins&amp;#8221; episode where a Mary Poppins-esque figure comes to the Simpson home. By the end of her stay, they&amp;#8217;re all neat, well-attired, and speaking with British accents. But, the very instant she steps out of the house, they&amp;#8217;re suddenly twice as bad as before she came.
Truthfully, it&amp;#8217;s not that bad (yet).</description>

      <description>It is 7:30 PM and no nurse has called to say that (s)he will be there in about half an hour to stick needles in little Sam&amp;#8217;s legs. No one is coming to weigh her. To ask how many wet and dirty diapers she had, to listen to her pulse, or to her breathing.
The forms they filled out for each visit were entertaining, and at least a little troublesome. Mostly, they used the &amp;#8220;6 Weeks &amp;#8212; 16 Years of Age&amp;#8221; form.</description>

      <description>We have an &amp;#8220;American Baby&amp;#8221; magazine which has various developmental milestones for babies. One of the &amp;#8220;Intellectual&amp;#8221; milestones under the &amp;#8220;1 Week&amp;#8221; category is &amp;#8220;Shuts out disturbing stimuli by lapsing into sleep.&amp;#8221; This brought a couple of things to mind.
 Wouldn&amp;#8217;t it be funny if this continued into adulthood? &amp;#8220;Oh no! The Huns are invad&amp;#8230;ZZZZZZZ&amp;#8221;

      <description>I was at PSU Altoona recently running errands and managed to see a few people. I was impressed by the number of people who are up to date on what&amp;#8217;s going on with Carolyn, Sam and myself based on reading my blog. It&amp;#8217;s still disarming when there are people in France (Salut Peggy, Salut Tara) who know more details about the birth of my child than my own parents. I am also amused by who does and doesn&amp;#8217;t read my blog on campus.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;#8217;t like to ask for help. I was raised to be an independent and self-sufficient individual, given more freedom and responsibility than most my age. This is doubly true when what I ask for help on is something that I am not only capable of doing myself, but should have already done. And it&amp;#8217;s still the more true when I&amp;#8217;m asking of a community of friends who have already been so incredibly generous.</description>

      <description>As we approach Sam&amp;#8217;s one-week anniversary, there are a couple of elements of the birth story that I&amp;#8217;ve not yet mentioned, but want to. But first, I can&amp;#8217;t believe it&amp;#8217;s been a whole week. Nor can I believe it&amp;#8217;s been only a week. It seems a world ago that we were breathing through the contractions. At the same time, it&amp;#8217;s been such a hectic whirlwind since, were there really 7 whole dark, night-like entities since then?</description>

      <description>I know, it&amp;#8217;s well past time for an update. What can I say? Busy day. So far, in Sam&amp;#8217;s life, there has not been a day when she has not had to go to the hospital. Hopefully, tomorrow will break this trend. I think I mentioned before that we&amp;#8217;ve got home health nurses coming twice a day to inject Sam with ampacillin. So far, the two nurses we&amp;#8217;ve had have been exceptionally caring and considerate people.</description>

      <description>OMG. I really can&amp;#8217;t believe what a nightmare this has become. Because Sam might have group b strep, we&amp;#8217;ve had to take her to the ER. We had to take her in only a few hours after we brought her home. (It&amp;#8217;s a half hour drive.) We had to take her in again this morning. We did. While we were there, the head nurse from &amp;#8220;Special Delivery&amp;#8221; came by. She said she thought it was stupid for dead-tired parents to drive a half an hour in each direction, and take a 3 to 4 day old, undersized baby into an emergency waiting room full of sick people twice a day.</description>

      <description>Mom-mom came today and she brought a treasure trove of outfits. Mostly from herself and grandaddy, but also from other Philadelphia area relatives. I&amp;#8217;m astonished at how much pink is suddenly in our house. One of the nice side effects of not having known the gender pre-birth is the neutral colors and style. But pink and dresses now abound. Not that she doesn&amp;#8217;t look cute as a button in a pink dress, but oh how early the gender stereotyping begins!</description>

      <description>We made it home. I was pleased. It was starting to feel manageable. I was even pretty close to being in a situation where I could upload some pictures when the midwife called and said that the placental culture was back and it had tested positive for group B Strep. A little later, a nurse from Nason special delivery calls. The pediatrician is worried that Sam might have it too, so they need to draw blood to check that, but the test takes 48 hours, so she needs to get antibiotic shots every 12 hours between now and the return of the test results.</description>

      <description>Friday evening 2 of us went into the hospital. This evening, 3 of us have come home. I can&amp;#8217;t describe (at least right now) how amazing it is. (And how I tear up at just about everything.) I&amp;#8217;m just overjoyed to have Sam in our lives.</description>

      <description>Sam will probably cringe and grimace when she gets old enough to read this and she sees the details I&amp;#8217;m sharing about her first days. But that&amp;#8217;s one of the key roles of parents-to embarass us beyond belief.
Today&amp;#8217;s embarassing tale is about urine. We were worried that she simply wasn&amp;#8217;t doing it. We change (or at least inspect) diapers with every feeding. We&amp;#8217;ve seen a couple of really good poops, but no pee.</description>

      <description>The first day of life has been a little rough. Mom and dad already need to be getting more sleep than they are. Breastfeeding didn&amp;#8217;t start easily despite a pretty good understanding of how it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;supposed&amp;#8221; to go. Recently, dad&amp;#8217;s been feeding Sam a special high-calorie formula from a small tube run along his pinkie finger. All sorts of pictures are being taken. Several of which are appropriate for a broader audience and so will find their way here or at least in the gallery, but not until all three of us come home (expected to be Tuesday morning.</description>

      <description>Phew. The &amp;#8220;official&amp;#8221; mail will come out tomorrow (well, later today), but I thought a quick note here would be nice. Our baby girl arrived just before 1:00 AM on Sunday, Oct. 2. She&amp;#8217;s a small one &amp;#8211; I don&amp;#8217;t have the length yet, Ca thinks she heard 17 inches &amp;#8211; but she&amp;#8217;s 5 pounds 4 ounces, we got to see that measurement take place. They were a bit worried about her right after birth, so they whisked her away for a while.</description>

      <description>At 6:00 the midwife wanted to break the water. She had done a test and we were stuck at 4cm. We managed to get an hour&amp;#8217;s reprive, which is just about up. I hope we&amp;#8217;ve progressed enough to further forstall it, but we&amp;#8217;ll see soon enough. The contractions are still irregular and manageable.</description>

      <description>For a while recently, Carolyn was having what they were calling &amp;#8220;late decells&amp;#8221;. Meaning that baby&amp;#8217;s heart rate was dropping (_decel_lerating) during the late part of contractions. This apparently means that baby is not tolerating the contractions well &amp;#8212; not getting enough oxygen during them so the heart rate declines. So, at the moment, the pit is off, Carolyn&amp;#8217;s on oxygen and resting. I&amp;#8217;m going to see if I can cat nap too.</description>

      <description>We had a bit of drama recently. The pitocin (actually oxytocin) level had been gradually pumped up to 8 mili-units. The contractions were coming a bit more regularly, but were still well under controll. Carolyn had been having some twinges of lower back pain, so the doula suggested a hands and knees position to try to pull the baby forward some. In that position, Carolyn felt no contractions at all, and none showed on the monitor.</description>

      <description>Carolyn is now on pitocin. They just upped the dose from the minimum they started her out on about 20 min. ago. The contractions are more frequent, but still pretty managable. She can talk through them. She greeted the most recent one with &amp;#8220;Oooh, here&amp;#8217;s one.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>No Internet access at the hospital. Will have to use my phone for subsequent updates. I really should have bought that keyboard for it. Oh well. We got checked in after a crazy afternoon of finishing packing and a quick meal at the local Mexican joint. Already, it&amp;#8217;s far more medical than I was prepared for, though I mean it&amp;#8217;s a hospital, I should have known. But she&amp;#8217;s had 3 vials of blood drawn, I don&amp;#8217;t even know for what.</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;re in a bit of a collective freak-out at the moment. We went in for our usual &amp;#8220;non-stress&amp;#8221; test and Biophysical profile (ultrasound) today. The BPP score was a 4 out of 8. They didn&amp;#8217;t see sufficient movement, nor fetal breathing. (I wish we&amp;#8217;d had the other ultrasound technician.) So, even though our non-stress test was fine, the doctor feels like the baby is now in a &amp;#8220;better out than in&amp;#8221; place.</description>

      <description>Today, I received my Official Coach Card indicating that Carolyn and I have completed our Bradley Method training in preparing for a &amp;#8220;natural&amp;#8221; birth. I (and I believe Carolyn) certainly benefited greatly from Tera Nelson&amp;#8217;s training, and feel much more prepared now than I(we) did even a scant month ago. Still, there&amp;#8217;s a twinge of nervousness (sometimes more like panic) about this very physical and quite unknown (to us) process that we have coming up.</description>

One of the things Carolyn picked out for me to potentially read to her were some passages from the Tao Te Ching. She picked a couple of my favorites.</description>

      <description>Now that Carolyn&amp;#8217;s 36 weeks pregnant, we get to go to the OB/GYN twice a week. Today was &amp;#8220;just&amp;#8221; a non-stress test &amp;#8211; almost a half hour, and an office visit. The office visit was interesting in that we met the doctor for the first time. Up until now, we&amp;#8217;ve only been seeing the midwives.
Dr. Littlejohn was an interesting character. We learned that he is a HAM radio enthusiast and that he went war-driving around Altoona with his son, finding hundreds of open wireless networks.</description>

This is a simple test of a plugin I just got for wordpress to hook up wordpress to gallery. If it works, there&amp;#8217;ll be an ultrasound picture above this. If it doesn&amp;#8217;t, then I&amp;#8217;ll be editing it until it does work. But not until after dinner. 😉
Well, it appears that I got it working. But I&amp;#8217;m still not sure I&amp;#8217;m satisfied. I think I want an intermediate size for in-blog pictures.</description>

Maybe my expectations were set too high. Maybe I&amp;#8217;ve been jaded by the predictable pattern of hero gets into trouble through no fault of his/her own. Hero gets out of trouble through use of skill/smarts/wit/humanity/whatever, all in the course of an hour.</description>

      <description>Carolyn and I had a perinatal day today. We had a fetal ultrasound with biophysical profile. We had an OB/GYN appointment. We had a quote &amp;#8220;non-stress&amp;#8220; test. Carolyn peed in a cup. (OK, to be fair, she has to pee in a cup every time we go to the OB/GYN [at their request, not her whim], but still, it was a long-ish day of poking and prodding.)
All of this (well most of this) because she&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;measuring small.</description>

So, instead we were going to have a little mini-tutorial. But then another couple contacted her (today?!?) and signed up. It&amp;#8217;s a 12 week course. We have only about 5 weeks left before the due date (assuming the baby is neither tardy nor hasty.</description>

      <description>We started the hunt for pediatric care today. Actually, we started a while ago, but we met our first potential pediatrician today &amp;#8212; a Dr. Delbaggio with &amp;#8220;Blair Medial Associates&amp;#8221;:http://www.blairmedicalassociates.com/peds.html. She seemed friendly and competent, but Blair Medial Associates is one of those large medical-industrial complex places. During the course of the interview we learned that we&amp;#8217;d be among the 10,000 patients that they currently service. How can you have a personal, caring relationship with 10,000 people?</description>

I was taking my dad on a tour of Altoona. We went to Lowes and Advance Auto, but also to the Wopsy Trail and the Horseshoe Curve.</description>

      <description>As I think I mentioned in the Life More Extraordinary post, we declined to (try) to learn the gender of our upcoming offspring. I&amp;#8217;m also pretty sure that Carolyn read that generally, men prefer to have boys. 
Not me. I hope she&amp;#8217;s a girl. That said, if she decides she wants to be a boy, that&amp;#8217;s fine too. I&amp;#8217;ll do my best to teach my child cross-gender skills. She will learn to fix toilets and ride motorcycles.</description>

      <description>On our way out the door this morning to get an ultrasound and have a prenatal appointment we got a phone call. The call was the OB/GYN canceling our prenatal appointment. Some other woman had the audacity to go into labor and take our midwife away during OUR appointment time. The nerve of some people, I tell you!
We did, however, still have the ultrasound appointment. It&amp;#8217;s a little bit early (19 weeks instead of ~21-22 weeks) because we declined the triple screen, and because of our impending travel.</description>

      <description>Carolyn and I have news that we&amp;#8217;ve been starting to share. What&amp;#8217;s most interesting about this process is people&amp;#8217;s reactions to it seem very personal, and certainly all over the map.
The news is that we&amp;#8217;re pregnant. Well, Carolyn&amp;#8217;s pregnant. I&amp;#8217;m just cranky, gaining weight and nauseated (nauseating?).
The reactions, as I&amp;#8217;ve mentioned, have been all over the map. As an artifact of who was home when, we told Carolyn&amp;#8217;s parents first.</description>

      <description>I was afraid of this, when I started. Creativity drought. Some of the things I have to say, simply can&amp;#8217;t be said yet. Others seem too mundane to say. Still more might be appropriate for this forum but feel like they&amp;#8217;ve arrived just so that I have something to say here.
I will doubtless have some stories next week though. This weekend will be interesting. I&amp;#8217;m going down to Richmond to spend some time with my dad for his birthday.</description>
