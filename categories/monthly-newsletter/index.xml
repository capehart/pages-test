      <description>Dear Sam,
Iâ€™m writing this to you on my 38th birthday. This morning when I got you up out of your crib, you asked, â€œWhat day is today?â€ I replied, â€œMonday.â€ Then you said, â€œItâ€™s Mommyâ€™s birthday! Happy Birthday, Mommy!â€ And you gave me a hug.
Best. Birthday. Present. Ever.
A few hours later, we were running errands on foot and you wanted me to carry you, and I was already lugging two bags of groceries, and you wouldnâ€™t wear your sun hat, and you kept telling me to take mine off, and you cried and complained for the last two blocks.</description>

      <description>Dear Sammy,
For your newsletter describing your 30th month of life, Iâ€™ve been collecting phrases that weâ€™ve heard around the house. These are the ones that make your Dad and me grin, or gasp, or sometimes grimace. But in each case, we look at each other and mouth â€œdid she just say that?â€
Here you go. Soundbites from a 2Â½ year-old girl:
â€œMommies donâ€™t go to work. Daddies do.â€
â€œIâ€™m not a big girl yet.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
I&amp;#8217;m not sure where to start for this month. I suppose all months are continuations of the previous, but that seems especially true this month. Probably because it took me getting half way through this month before finally abdicating last month&amp;#8217;s newsletter to your mother. Regardless, this month was full of growth and change for you. Mom indicates that you&amp;#8217;ve been &amp;#8220;speaking in paragraphs&amp;#8221; for some time now. I&amp;#8217;m not really sure how or when that happened, but you do string together related sentences.</description>

      <description>Dear Sammy,
Dad and I are a few weeks late with this newsletter. You (and the people we share this letter with) will have to forgive us: your 28th month was a difficult oneâ€”not because of you, but because this past month saw the death of a longtime family member: our beloved kitty Camus.
Iâ€™m going to start there. He died near the end of the month, but his death has colored the entire month.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Well, Chrissum time is over. Alas, by the end you were saying &amp;#8220;Christmas&amp;#8221; about as often as you said Crissum. Your little approximations of words are cute and fleeting. Already I miss getting to hear the babble of your baby talk and wish I&amp;#8217;d found a way to record more of it. This month has begun a real inquisitive phase for you. You have a hard time being adjacent to a conversation without saying something like &amp;#8220;What&amp;#8217;s mommy and daddy talking about?</description>

      <description>&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s Crissum Time!&amp;#8221; Dear Sam,
Before you came into our lives, I knew, and almost certainly used, the phrase &amp;#8220;childlike delight,&amp;#8221; but I really don&amp;#8217;t think I had the visceral sense of the meaning of that phrase until you showed up to demonstrate it for me. You love looking at people&amp;#8217;s Christmas lights (Crissum lights) &amp;#8212; including our own. You&amp;#8217;ve even interrupted whatever play was going on at the time to simply call out, in case anyone forgot, that &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s Crissum time!</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
When I put you down for your afternoon nap just now, you sang along to your bedtime song â€œSamantha, fais dodo.â€ I was trying not to smile too hard, because, you knowâ€¦ itâ€™s nap time and you have a hard enough time as it is settling down to rest. When we finished the song, you exclaimed â€œSammy did it!â€ After I left the room, you reprised the song, and then added a few rounds of â€œFrÃ¨re Jacques,â€ followed by a rousing rendition of â€œPop Goes the Weasel.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Well, it&amp;#8217;s not quite month 25 yet, but this is certainly the latest I&amp;#8217;ve been for a while. It&amp;#8217;s going to be hard not to talk about where you are now, but to restrict it to where you were then. Even though then and now are only a few weeks apart!
I guess let&amp;#8217;s start with linguistic development. Impressive as usual. You have a large nursery rhyme book that you enjoy.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
It&amp;#8217;s been a quarter of a year since I last wrote your newsletter! Thank goodness Mom stepped up to the plate. She also saved my butt this month as I have a &amp;#8220;notes&amp;#8221; email from her containing what could be considered &amp;#8220;talking points&amp;#8221; for this newsletter. Two thing really stand out for me in particular this month though:
1) Jumping and Skipping. You really enjoy both of them. You also enjoy requesting them of me.</description>

      <description>Dear Sammy,
Daddy was going to write your letter this month, but since a) heâ€™s sick, and b) heâ€™s working for SIGGRAPH at San Diego this week, and c) youâ€™re giving me a nice long nap this afternoon, I decided that I would start it.
So, hi Sammy! Happy 22 months old! Youâ€™re two months away from two years old. Technically. In practical terms, youâ€™re right smack dab in the middle of the Terrible Twoâ€™s.</description>

      <description>Dear Sammy,
I have a lot to tell you about this past month, but first let me tell you a little anecdote that has completely charmed your father and me. We still end your day with a reading of Time for Bed (by Mem Fox)â€”a little story book we received when you were born. Weâ€™ve been reading it to you since you were about 4 months old. Each page has a little rhyme about a parent animal telling the baby animal that itâ€™s time for sleep.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Wow. What a month. It is a real pleasure when your mom takes one of the monthly newsletters because it helps me recharge and get more energy and enthusiasm for writing. This month is a pleasure to write not just because of that break though. So much has happened in the past month, I barely know where to begin.
I guess I want to start with your verbal development, as despite everything else, that has what has impressed me so consistantly this month.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
April has always been one of my favorite months, as it usually heralds the arrival of spring: longer, lighter days, breezy weather, delicate daffodils, and peeping baby frogs. Academics, however, like to quote T.S. Eliotâ€™s â€œThe Waste Landâ€ and proclaim that â€œApril is the cruelest month.â€ While it is true that the last month of the academic semester usually entails a mountain of grading, I always welcomed April gladly because it meant that the end of tedium and the beginning of May freedom was near.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Do you have anything in your life that you&amp;#8217;re (almost) always glad that you&amp;#8217;ve done, you usually enjoy doing, but you dislike (or just have a hard time) starting? I have several of these. Working out is one of them. I have a hard time getting from the house to the front door of the gym. Once I&amp;#8217;m through the doors, I usually enjoy myself, and when I&amp;#8217;m done a workout, I rarely regret having been.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Some of the other moms that brings kids to your tot group remarked, &amp;#8220;Oooh, 17 months, that&amp;#8217;s a rough age.&amp;#8221; If that&amp;#8217;s the case, I can&amp;#8217;t wait to see a great age, because you&amp;#8217;ve been a real pleasure to be around this month. It&amp;#8217;s true that you&amp;#8217;re starting to explore this thing we call a tantrum, but the ones I&amp;#8217;ve been exposed to have been pretty managable, and we&amp;#8217;ve gotten you out of them without too much trouble.</description>

      <description>Dear Samantha,
Tomorrow you will turn 16 months old. Back in Pennsylvania, a little groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil will stick his little brown nose out of his hole-in-the-dirt house and venture out into the air. Hundreds of people will watch to see if he sees his shadow. If he does, folklore has it that there will be six more weeks of winter. If not, there will be an early spring. I was saying to your Dad the other day that I doubt people in the San Francisco Bay area pay much attention to Groundhog Day.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Already it&amp;#8217;s been almost a month and a half, since I&amp;#8217;ve written your newsletter. Yet, in some ways it seems to me like I just wrote your month 14 newsletter. I&amp;#8217;ll be fascinated to see how both of us have a changing perception of time as we both mature. I remember as a child ((I was about to write &amp;#8216;kid&amp;#8217; here, but then remembered that as a kid, I wouldn&amp;#8217;t let anyone refer to me as &amp;#8216;kid&amp;#8217; because it (also) meant &amp;#8216;baby goat.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
It&amp;#8217;s been a while since I (Dad) have written your monthly newsletter. I&amp;#8217;ve been fortunate that your mom has been willing to take up the challenge during the time that I was out in California without you guys, and during your transition out here. But I&amp;#8217;m back (and with a new interface on the blog) and do I get a great month to write about.

      <description>Dear Sam,

Urban babies
wear black.  Today you turn 13 months old, which means we have completed the first month of your second year of life. This means that for the past month, weâ€™ve been saying things like â€œOh, remember this time last yearâ€¦?â€ This time last year you were too small for the Halloween costume we had for you (a black cat), we barely noticed the change back to Standard Time, I was still getting the hang of feeding you, and Daddy and I spent the better part of the days in pajamas.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,

She sure is cute  Do you hear that noise? Thatâ€™s your parents laughing and crying and jumping up and down because you turned ONE YEAR old, which means we MADE IT! We survived the first year, and here you are laughing, smiling, talking, and nearly walking. One full orbit around the sun and our newborn blob has become a little person with opinions and personality. Dad and I feel like we can finally breathe after 365 days of worry.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Iâ€™ve been writing this letter to you in mind for weeks now, but until now I havenâ€™t managed to spill the words onto a page. I hope youâ€™ll cut me a little slack, because, you know, in addition to everything else going on during your 11th month, there was the little matter of that CROSS-COUNTRY move. Oh yes. You began this month in Altoona, PA and ended it in El Cerrito, CA.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Iâ€™m writing this to you in your Uncle Johnâ€™s old room at Gradyville, PA. You are asleep in my old room, clutching a toy car and set of plastic keys. The knees of your purple pants are filthy, your feet are covered in carpet fuzz and cat fur, and your round little tummy rises and falls rhythmically, straining against the straps of the car seat you fell asleep in.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
I have big shoes to fill (you can take that figuratively or literally, as you like, because yes, your daddy has big feet). Since your daddy spent this past month in California, it is up to me to provide the chronicle of your ninth month.
Nine months! Good lord, child, youâ€™ve now been out for as long as you were in. How did that happen? When I look at your impish smile and the light tripping in your eyes I can barely recall the tiny, sleepy newborn Sam that used to fit along the length of my arm from elbow to palm.</description>

      <description>My dearest Samantha,
As I start writing this, I&amp;#8217;m on an airplane flying away from you. We&amp;#8217;ll be separated for weeks. Alas, as I look this over for posting, it&amp;#8217;s already almost three weeks later. The job, and the housing search have been consuming my time. I had heard reports from a couple of people who had been out of work for a while about how long the days seemed when they finally were back in the 9-5 workforce.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Wow. Another month whipped by. I can&amp;#8217;t believe how quickly it feels like April went. Of course, for you, it was one seventh of your life, and for me it was about one three hundred and fortieth, so we&amp;#8217;re bound to have at least slightly different takes on it. That said, looking back, your mom and I still managed to come up with a number of things regarding your development that we think noteworthy.</description>

      <title>Monthly Newsletter — Month 6</title>

      <description>Dear Sam,

Cute Sam  When I started this, &amp;#8220;monthly&amp;#8221; seemed like the right time frame. In fact, it seemed a little aggressive. Thinking about my own life, it seems that little actually changes month-to-month. Maybe my vocabulary increased by 1 word (this month, it was papabile), maybe I put on a pound, (or took if off if I was lucky). I was worried that I&amp;#8217;d have nothing to say about your growth.</description>

      <description>Samantha,
I&amp;#8217;m just about ready to stop apologizing for the fact that your monthly newsletter, while coming out every month, does not, in fact, come out on (or even very close to) your actual, specific birthday. I&amp;#8217;m a more sporadic blogger than I&amp;#8217;d like to be, and your newsletter suffers somewhat for that fact. Nonetheless, it&amp;#8217;s here now, and I&amp;#8217;m pleased to report that your fifth month was once again a banner month for you.</description>

      <description>Cutest. Baby. Ever.
  Well, Sam, I&amp;#8217;m off to a late start again, but I&amp;#8217;ve not forgotten your newsletter. As in previous months, a lot has changed this month. Highlighting these changes has been your basic physical shape. I&amp;#8217;ve been facinated by reviewing pictures from previous months. Dr. Karp (The Happiest Baby on the Block) talks about the first three months as the &amp;#8220;fourth trimester&amp;#8221; and it was certainly a reasonable description for you.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,

Once again, I find myself writing your monthly newsletter well past the end of your month. I have a little bit better excuse this month &amp;#8212; we were traveling back from Mom-mom and Granddaddy&amp;#8217;s on the day you turned 3 months old. This trip was interestingly exhausting and recharging for me. You didn&amp;#8217;t seem to care much one way or the other, except you seemed to like some of the music you heard while you were there.</description>

      <description>Samantha,
Imagine if you will: You&amp;#8217;re on a TGV or Bullet Train. You&amp;#8217;re traveling through snowy, mountainous countryside. As you speed along, you pass through regularly spaced tunnels each a little bit longer and closer than the previous. As a result, it&amp;#8217;s alternately light and dark, and you hear a bit of a whoosh sound as you make each transition. That&amp;#8217;s what this past month has been like for me.</description>

      <description>Dear Samantha,
As I write you this first of monthly newsletters, you are asleep in my lap. One of your arms is raised straight up in the air, fingers spread wide, with your index finger slightly forward of the rest of the arc of your fingers. If I could reach the camera without disturbing your rest, I&amp;#8217;d definitely be preserving this for posterity. I enjoy how you still don&amp;#8217;t quite understand that the various parts of your body belong to you, and while there are ways in which I&amp;#8217;m very much looking forward to your maturation, I will miss this phase.</description>
