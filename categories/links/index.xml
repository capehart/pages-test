      <description>This link made the rounds at work today. I shared it with bk and Carolyn, my only (semi-)regular non-Linden workday correspondents, and Carolyn suggested I blog it. I won&amp;#8217;t steal the thunder from the article to recreate it here, but it&amp;#8217;s a short read and reasonably insightful if perhaps a little over-broad. It&amp;#8217;s about the &amp;#8220;tact filter&amp;#8221; and its orientation between nerds and &amp;#8220;normal&amp;#8221; people. [[In an age where people have &amp;#8216;(re)claimed&amp;#8217; geekness to the point where &amp;#8216;athletics geek&amp;#8217; is no longer a completely laughable oxymoron, is there such a thing as a &amp;#8216;normal&amp;#8217; person?</description>

      <description>A friend of mine from work, Yoz, keeps introducing me (sometimes, indirectly) to addictive little shockwave games. Here&amp;#8217;s another one of them: Desktop Tower Defense. The main problem is that it can take a good deal of time to get through. But like all good games, the time goes really quickly, at least subjectively!</description>
