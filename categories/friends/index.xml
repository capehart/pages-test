      <description>I can&amp;#8217;t believe it&amp;#8217;s been nearly a quarter since my last update. Certainly, I&amp;#8217;ve been keeping pretty busy. Singing Horse Studio is doing well, and starting to get as much work as we can handle. We now need to work on managing our growth. Another tricky area for a young business &amp;mdash; actually for ANY business. We&amp;#8217;ve expanded into the USA having successfully registered with the Virginia State Corporation Comission on July 1st, 2011.</description>

      <title>Mail Rank</title>

      <description>I have two really smart friends who are building MailRank. I don&amp;#8217;t know more than they&amp;#8217;ve posted online or made inferences from their name, but I think they are trying to make email distinguish between the stuff you do care about (mail from your spouse) and stuff that&amp;#8217;s not spam, but you don&amp;#8217;t care about (mail from the bike shop, mail from your mom). If it works (and, to be sure, I&amp;#8217;ve got no idea how it possibly could), I&amp;#8217;d love to get a &amp;#8220;biff&amp;#8221; style notification of &amp;#8220;mail I do care about&amp;#8221;!</description>

      <description>There are people in my life who, when they keep re-appearing, cause me to ask myself why. I can only assume it&amp;#8217;s because they have a lesson to teach me and I&amp;#8217;ve not learned it yet. I have to assume it&amp;#8217;s something about communication style with this individual. As Carolyn put it, &amp;#8220;Some geeks are cute. Their social awkwardness leading to a shyness that can be endearing. Others are just off-putting.</description>

      <description>I am a couple of months behind in reading Wired, and just came across Clive Thomson&amp;#8217;s article on Twitter. Anyone who follows me (OK, just Yoz) knows how infrequently I update.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#8217;s about like this blog.&amp;nbsp; There are two bits of it that struck a chord with me:
 Productivity guru Tim Ferriss calls Twitter &amp;#8220;pointless email on steroids.&amp;#8221;
 I had a very similar reaction to it when I first stumbled across it.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;#8217;t mentioned it here much, but every Sunday, I played soccer with a few other people &amp;#8212; mostly Penn State people, but we&amp;#8217;ve picked up a few neighbors and others.

Altoona, PA 2006  I started this after having played wallyball with Mike &amp;#8212; they don&amp;#8217;t play in the summer, and there had been a little bit of buzz about it. Someone else started it up, but quickly stopped coming, and I gladly took over.</description>

      <description>We had a fun &amp;#8220;First Friday&amp;#8221; games night last night. If you weren&amp;#8217;t invited, but should have been, send me an email.
It was a small group because I announced it so late, but we had fun. We started with Fluxx, then played Kill Dr. Lucky and ended up with some Magic.
I&amp;#8217;m still yawning from the late night, though. And Sam kept Carolyn pretty busy, so she was unable to join us.</description>

      <description>We were actually willing to entertain folks a little while before we left for the holidays, but I never got around to blogging it. Afternoons are best. Please email (or call) to schedule a visit, and give us a call a little before you come over to make sure we&amp;#8217;ve not accidentally just set the house on fire. If you&amp;#8217;re sick, or think you might be, please postpone your visit. She&amp;#8217;ll still be an infant next week too, and we&amp;#8217;ll all be a much happier family if she&amp;#8217;s a well infant next week.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;#8217;t think he reads my blog, at least not with any regularity, but yesterday my brother-in-law IM&amp;#8217;ed me this URL: a newsgroup I posted to in 1991, in which I discuss a variety of topics from the LPMud I was helping run at the time, to the future of VR, to teledildonics &amp;#8212; all on a thread started by Howard Rheingold.
Does anything on the internet ever really die? Who reads a nntp://sci.</description>

      <description>I was talking with my friend, Rebecca, the visual artist, the other day. I now forget who it was she was ragging on &amp;#8212; some group of geeky or artsy people. She said they had&amp;#8230; I think the description she used was, &amp;#8220;horribly, ugly home pages.&amp;#8221;
I thought that anyone who would offer a critique like that must be pretty proud of how her own home page looked, so I googled her.</description>

      <description>My brother-in-law and his wife (my sister-in-law-in-law?) are here from the NYC suburbs for thanksgiving. In an effort to show them that we don&amp;#8217;t live in a cultural wasteland &amp;#8212; which, ya know, compared to NYC, we pretty much do &amp;#8212; we showed them my audiotron which gets a variety of international radio stations. As she is Japanese-American, we put on &amp;#8220;Osaka Hit Radio&amp;#8221; and some other Japanese AM (and web-broadcast) radio station.</description>

      <description>We had Donna and Rebecca over for dinner tonight. They are the two amazing women who put together the wonderful baby shower for Carolyn, helped me paint rooms in the house, etc. They&amp;#8217;ve been quite a treat to have in our lives. Anyway, Rebecca brought over a CD of photos that she took at the event, so I uploaded them into the photo gallery.
 Also, this week, I got a couple of pictures of my friend David.</description>

      <description>I know why we&amp;#8217;re in Altoona. I even appreciate it. I like the new friends we&amp;#8217;ve made. But I miss the comfort and convenience of old friends. Even some colleagues from Kesmai. There are enough stocky people with dark hair that every now and again I think I see Stuart Holme in the distance. I miss his uncomplicated appreciation of life. I miss my friend Nancy (not a Charlottesvillian) with whom I seem to often have an understanding that exists outside of spoken communication.</description>

      <description>I received an email recently from a &amp;#8220;long lost&amp;#8221; almost-relative, Rob. He had proposed marriage to my aunt Donna. She only declined because she was dying of Cystic Fibrosis and didn&amp;#8217;t want to saddle him with that. My aunt is now long dead, as is Rob&amp;#8217;s second (well, OK, FIRST) wife (also of CF). He&amp;#8217;s recently remarried and he and his new wife bought a house. He mentioned in his email that they had 9 particular things that they&amp;#8217;d wanted in a house, and this house had them all and then some.</description>

      <description>I made a promise that I regret. I told bk that if I posted two more blog entries in the coming 7 days that he could announce my (unread) blog on his (somewhat more read) blog. I regret this not because I fear my voice being heard by the unwashed masses &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s been too long since my shower anyway &amp;#8212; no, I regret it because it&amp;#8217;s got me thinking about number and size of blog content in a way that feels inappropriate to the spirit of blogging.</description>
