      <description>I am reminded this weekend of why it is that we uprooted our lives and moved across the country.
For starters, weather. As I write this, it&amp;#8217;s 2-degrees F in Altoona. Here, it&amp;#8217;s 54-degrees F.
This weekend, we went to the Berkeley marina where we stumbled upon the Cal Sailing Club which I intend to join. Right there, there was also an adventure park which we did not yet explore and another playground where Sam stomped around in the sand, rode on the swings, and slid down the slide.</description>

      <description>While I have been missing some of the aspects of our previous life (see previous post) &amp;#8212; one aspect I&amp;#8217;m not missing so far is the weather!
Today in Altoona, PA, was a high of 48 degrees F with a low of 32 (and a chance of light snow.)
Today in El Cerrito, CA was a high of 72 degrees F with a low of 49.</description>

      <description>There&amp;#8217;s been a little bit of activity on our home in Altoona. We have a contract with a contingency that the buyer needs to sell his home, and we just learned that he had a contract. While I&amp;#8217;m terribly excited that soon we won&amp;#8217;t be having to pay both rent and mortgage, and glad not to own a house that would otherwise sit unattended through a winter, I&amp;#8217;m still a little saddened by it.</description>

      <description>I think it was yesterday, maybe it was the day before &amp;#8212; time gets so lost right now &amp;#8212; when Sam made the half of the (stereo-)typical baby noise. She said &amp;#8220;Ga&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; Now all we need is a &amp;#8220;Goo&amp;#8221; to go with it, and we&amp;#8217;ll be set!
Also, people are coming tomorrow to see the house! It&amp;#8217;s still not in great shape, but mostly it&amp;#8217;s just clutter. I&amp;#8217;ve finished the work I want to do to it (mostly thanks to the family helping out last weekend.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve made a page for it, rather than a regular blog entry because I don&amp;#8217;t want it to fade from view (until it&amp;#8217;s sold). We listed our house on Monday with the Real Estate Agent who helped us buy it. It&amp;#8217;s such a treasure &amp;#8212; we don&amp;#8217;t want to leave it behind, but as good as the Linden Lab relocation budget is &amp;#8212; I don&amp;#8217;t think it would actually cover picking up the house and moving it to San Francisco.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;#8217;t mentioned it here much, but every Sunday, I played soccer with a few other people &amp;#8212; mostly Penn State people, but we&amp;#8217;ve picked up a few neighbors and others.

Altoona, PA 2006  I started this after having played wallyball with Mike &amp;#8212; they don&amp;#8217;t play in the summer, and there had been a little bit of buzz about it. Someone else started it up, but quickly stopped coming, and I gladly took over.</description>

      <description>Whew. I&amp;#8217;ve been holding my breath and biting my tongue on this for so long, it&amp;#8217;s really cramped my blogging style. Finally, today I can write about it. I&amp;#8217;m up-heaving our lives!
During a long walk during the winter time, Carolyn and I took stock of our lives as we tend to do during long walks together. We found ourselves out in the cold, walking among the depressed (and depressing) houses of Altoona with our baby daughter strapped to us.</description>

      <description>OK, so this is kind of a Sam post. But since two of these happened today, I thought they should go up.
Real Baby?
Who can tell?  Carolyn and I were walking toward the post office. I was carrying Sam in the baby bj&amp;ouml;rn, and an older woman in one of those golfcart/wheelchair hybrids rolled along toward us. She stopped her cart to ask, in amazement, &amp;#8220;Is that a real baby?</description>

      <description>The Pennsylvania Turnpike is an expensive but expedient way for us to get back to the Philadelphia area where Mom-mom and Granddaddy live. It is narrow, busy, and often under (much-needed) repair.
When we were in Pittsburgh for Carolyn&amp;#8217;s birthday last year, we picked up whatever the local City Paper-style paper is called. In it, there was an article or editorial lambasting the Pennsylvania Turnpike which, among other things, called it a blight on the face of Pennsylvania.</description>

      <description>I had just finished a long phone conversation with my mom, and was talking it over with Carolyn when we heard what sounded like fireworks outside. I thought it wasn&amp;#8217;t close enough to June to be fireworks season, and then it dawned on me. Maybe the Steelers had won the Superbowl. Altoona is close enough to Pittsburgh that this is considered &amp;#8220;Steeler Country.&amp;#8221; So, I went to superbowl.com and reported, &amp;#8220;Yep, we won.</description>

      <description>Pop-pop (my dad) arrived yesterday evening, and in so doing, Sam has met her last biological grandparent &amp;#8212; She still hasn&amp;#8217;t met &amp;#8220;Gramma Carolyn&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; Pop-pop&amp;#8217;s wife. I picked up Pop-pop from the Altoona train station after pretty much an all-day Amtrak trip from Richmond, VA. At least the price was right &amp;#8212; less than he&amp;#8217;d have paid in gas to make the drive. In a sense, he met Sam at a good time.</description>

      <description>Today was Mom&amp;#8217;s first day back at work. Fortunately, as a professor, she has a pretty flexible schedule and is due home within the hour. Still, Sam and I were largely on our own. We&amp;#8217;ve made it so far, though it was touch-and-go for a little while there.
One of the things that we did today before our early-afternoon nap was to go for a walk. It was a beautiful day (for January) here, and I&amp;#8217;ve been noticing the lack of exercise brought about by the combination of having an infant at home and crappy weather outside.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been meaning to write about this first one for a while. In the early days of Sam, we received a lot of stuff. We&amp;#8217;re (Carolyn&amp;#8217;s) gradually making it through our thank-you note list, but one thing remains a mystery. And a fairly significant one too. We received a rocking chair. It was shortly after both Pop-pop and a family friend named &amp;#8220;Jo&amp;#8221; said they&amp;#8217;d send gifts, but gifts from each of them came the same day or shortly thereafter.</description>

      <description>I grew up in North Carolina. We didn&amp;#8217;t get much snow. As a kid, we&amp;#8217;d drive to the north for Christmas with my grandparents. I understood that further North meant colder meant greater likelihood of snow. What I didn&amp;#8217;t understand was that Richmond, VA &amp;#8212; not so much &amp;#8220;North.&amp;#8221; Still, we&amp;#8217;d take my sled up, strapped to the bike rack on the back of the family VW bug. And it did snow, in Richmond, just enough to keep a kid&amp;#8217;s hope up &amp;#8212; though an actual white Christmas was still pretty rare.</description>

      <description>Update: Fixed day of week. (thanks bk) Apparently sleep deprivation also means inability to actually read a calendar. Pretty funny when you consider the nature of this post.
Being that we now live in a proper neighborhood, complete with neighbors, and now that we have a kid, it seems like it is time to start participating in the whole Halloween thing again. We bought a great deal of candy. We turned on our front porch (and lamp post) lights.</description>

      <description>We went back to the pediatrician&amp;#8217;s office today. I think I may have mentioned earlier that Sam&amp;#8217;s supposed to be gaining an ounce a day at this stage of life. So, she should have gained 7 ounces since we were last there. She gained 3.1. She&amp;#8217;s now at 5lbs, 11 oz. We&amp;#8217;ve been told to increase the frequency of the supplements &amp;#8212; We&amp;#8217;d been doing 2 a day. We&amp;#8217;re now going for 3-4.</description>

      <description>A while back, I took my car into the dealer for service. Since Carolyn gave her car back to her parents, we have just the one vehicle. I dropped her off at work, then dropped the car off at the dealer. I had to use the courtesy shuttle to get back home. I told the driver where I lived, and off we went. Soon, he turned off of the route that I expected him to take.</description>

      <description>OK, it&amp;#8217;s lantern light, not candle light, but the idea&amp;#8217;s pretty similar. And I&amp;#8217;ve been doing a lot of it lately.
Maybe a couple of weeks after I penned The bk Life, bk asked me if I&amp;#8217;d computed on the back porch again. At the time I had not. But the weather has been too beautiful here to stay in the basement. I&amp;#8217;ve got a mouse, and I&amp;#8217;m more-or-less used to the screen size.</description>

      <description>I know why we&amp;#8217;re in Altoona. I even appreciate it. I like the new friends we&amp;#8217;ve made. But I miss the comfort and convenience of old friends. Even some colleagues from Kesmai. There are enough stocky people with dark hair that every now and again I think I see Stuart Holme in the distance. I miss his uncomplicated appreciation of life. I miss my friend Nancy (not a Charlottesvillian) with whom I seem to often have an understanding that exists outside of spoken communication.</description>

      <description>[rant]
As you probably know, we bought a house recently. With that sort of thing comes taxes. For the actual sale itself, the state takes 2%. 1% is paid directly to the state by the borrower, the other 1% is paid by the borrower first to the seller who then pays it to the state.
Then there are property taxes. Because I own property, the state lays claim to some of my money based again on either what I paid for that property, or (often worse) what it thinks I could get for it if I sold it.</description>

      <description>I accidentally went to mass yesterday. I&amp;#8217;m going to pause for a moment and let you re-read and marvel at that sentence; I accidentally went to mass yesterday. (Sidenote: Carolyn says that since I didn&amp;#8217;t stay for communion, I didn&amp;#8217;t really go to mass. Read on for the details.)
I was taking my dad on a tour of Altoona. We went to Lowes and Advance Auto, but also to the Wopsy Trail and the Horseshoe Curve.</description>

So, the other day, Carolyn and I were walking to the mailbox a few blocks from our house. We go there because the pick up is early-ish (11:30 AM) and we seem to have good luck getting our DVDs back to Netflix pretty quickly when shipped from there.</description>

      <description>I received an email recently from a &amp;#8220;long lost&amp;#8221; almost-relative, Rob. He had proposed marriage to my aunt Donna. She only declined because she was dying of Cystic Fibrosis and didn&amp;#8217;t want to saddle him with that. My aunt is now long dead, as is Rob&amp;#8217;s second (well, OK, FIRST) wife (also of CF). He&amp;#8217;s recently remarried and he and his new wife bought a house. He mentioned in his email that they had 9 particular things that they&amp;#8217;d wanted in a house, and this house had them all and then some.</description>

      <description>Yeah. It&amp;#8217;s the Sunday before the last week of the &amp;#8220;spring&amp;#8221; semester, and it&amp;#8217;s snowing. SNOWING! To be fair, it&amp;#8217;s a light, blustery snow that&amp;#8217;s not sticking to anything. But, c&amp;#8217;mon already. We were having a BEAUTIFUL spring.
In Charlottesville, it seemed like there was always a week or so every winter in which it was balmy and beautiful. Don&amp;#8217;t tell me that in Altoona we&amp;#8217;ll get a week or so every summer in which it&amp;#8217;s DARK AND SNOWY!</description>

      <description>Well, after much back and forth, we have an agreement to buy the house. It should be a happy occasion, and truthfully, it mostly is. But I&amp;#8217;m still a bit pissy about $250.00. That&amp;#8217;s right. We&amp;#8217;ve come to an agreement on approximately $150,000, and I&amp;#8217;m pissy about $250.00. Let me break it down for you.
First, the seller is an old lady. A recent widow who&amp;#8217;s lived in that house since 1973.</description>

      <description>Well, as I said we would, we made an offer on the house &amp;#8212; 512 28th Ave today. And we received a counter offer this evening.
The asking price was $155K. We offered $145K, and asked for a late closing date (so we don&amp;#8217;t have to pay a rent and mortgage the same month), and every appliance in the place (even the snowblower!). We got a counter offer &amp;#8212; everything but the snow blower, $149,500, but an extra $3000 in that goes into escrow with her agent (we already included $1000 in what my mom called &amp;#8220;ernest money&amp;#8221; to show that we&amp;#8217;re serious about the offer).</description>

      <description>Well, we finally engaged a real estate agent. We met with her (and an associated mortgage person) on Thursday, and put together a list of houses to see which we did, today.
We saw a total of 5. Of those five, it breaks down like this:
#1 Nice, everything we need, more on it later.
#2 Funky. Old. Sideways-looking. Awesome neighborhood. Awesome hardwood floors. Semi-renovated. Too expensive. Sucky closets. Only heat in basement was wood stove.</description>

      <description>I really didn&amp;#8217;t expect this. We were going to a few open houses. That was all. We were going to see a few places to get a feel for the neighborhoods as well as what our money would buy. Who knows, maybe even find that exact gem of a house we are looking for.
We saw a large and rambly 4 bedroom rancher from the 50&amp;#8217;s. The only significant updates since then were some new appliances (the old ones were still in the garage) and a new roof.</description>

      <description>Well, the &amp;#8220;70&amp;#8217;s palace&amp;#8221; that I talked about here has been sold. And no, not to us. I went for a bike ride yesterday and rode by the house. The for sale signs were gone, and there was a pickup in the drive way and stuff in the garage.
On that same bike ride, however, I went past a house that I&amp;#8217;d ridden past in the fall. In the fall, it was a FSBO, that when I finally got around to showing to Carolyn, the for sale sign was already gone.</description>

      <title>Home Shopping Begins</title>

      <description>Although it feels a little early for it given our lease constraints, we started home shopping in Altoona today in a slightly more serious way. Today, we visted the first house that we actually went inside. We took several pictures [link since removed since we didn&amp;#8217;t buy this house -ed] but even as many as we took, I still want to have taken more.
House summary: Built in 1983, it&amp;#8217;s a 3 bedroom, 3 bath home with oversized 2 car garage on a 100&amp;#8217;x120&amp;#8242; lot on the corner of Lloyd St and E.</description>

      <description>Already, I&amp;#8217;m glad I entered the Google AdSense program. I&amp;#8217;ve been crawled by googlebot a fair amount recently, but apparently, they still don&amp;#8217;t have enough info to put together real ads for my page(s). Instead, I can either run a background color (which I had been doing) or public service announcements for which I don&amp;#8217;t get paid. As you can see, as of this writing at least, I&amp;#8217;m now doing the latter.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;d been getting a bit weary of the perpetual gray of a dusky-overcast Altoona. It snowed yesterday, and it&amp;#8217;s sunny today. It may be freakin&amp;#8217; cold out, but at least it&amp;#8217;s a much prettier view out the office window today.
(There, I did it. I hate reading other people&amp;#8217;s long blog entries. What have they got to say that can&amp;#8217;t be said in a paragraph or two, and why would I want to read all that?</description>
