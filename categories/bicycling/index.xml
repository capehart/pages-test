      <description>Saturday: Ditchling Beacon to Devil&amp;#8217;s Dyke (route) (photos)
Sunday: Lewes Castle to Brighton (route) (photos)
Originally, this weekend, we had planned to train up to Gatwick and from there to take a trail along to Pooh Corner and the Hundred acre woods. We had that queued up for Sunday so decided to go for a walk on Saturday. Only we slept in on Sunday because Saturday&amp;#8217;s walk tired us out, so we gave up Pooh Corner in favor of Lewes Castle.</description>

      <description>The route with
Simon   &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Two weekends ago, I went out with Simon and we tooled around in the woods and on bridle trails (usually!) for 20-odd miles. My rides with Simon have been a delight, if not exactly purposeful. Like any riding, it&amp;amp;#8217;s only a matter of making the time for &amp;amp;#8217;em. Cycling remains for me the one form of exercise that I don&amp;amp;#8217;t think of as exercise, but as fun.</description>

      <description>I went for a bit of a meander-y bike ride today. For a good bit of it, I was on San Pablo Ave (see map below.)
San Pablo Ave is 4 lanes of automotive traffic, and has occasional bike lanes. At one point I was honked at, presumably for not being &amp;#8220;in my place&amp;#8221; in the bike lane. I&amp;#8217;m not sure I was flipped off, but I sure was startled so just in case, I [I went for a bit of a meander-y bike ride today.</description>

      <title>Another Saturday, another exhilarating bicycle ride</title>

      <description>I tweeted that I was going to drag myself outside today, and probably be glad I did. I did, and I was. I decided to go for a wander on my street bicycle. I&amp;#8217;d not gotten more than a couple hundred yards when I had a little trouble shifting, so I immediately turned around to diagnose with tools at home. I eventually decided that the support for Sam&amp;#8217;s sidecar was pinching the shifter cable.</description>

      <title>Adrenaline junkie? Moi?</title>

      <description>I don&amp;#8217;t really think of myself as an adrenaline junkie, but the way I&amp;#8217;m beaming at the moment may be betraying me. I just got back from a mountain bike ride. It was amazing (or if you&amp;#8217;re reading this from the UK, it was brilliant. Or if you&amp;#8217;re reading this on teh inter webz, it was teh awesome)!
The girls are away, there are trails nearby that I&amp;#8217;ve only begun to explore, I had no plans for the day, and because it&amp;#8217;s California, the weather was simply perfect.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m having trouble sleeping, so I thought I would &amp;#8220;pen&amp;#8221; this entry which I&amp;#8217;ve meant to do for a while now&amp;#8230;
So, the other day, Carolyn and I were walking to the mailbox a few blocks from our house. We go there because the pick up is early-ish (11:30 AM) and we seem to have good luck getting our DVDs back to Netflix pretty quickly when shipped from there.</description>

      <description>Yay! Spring visited Altoona today. I don&amp;#8217;t know how long it will last, but today was glorious. It got up to close to 70. It was sunny. The snow is gone from all but the highest and shadiest parts of the area.
I went for my first &amp;#8220;real&amp;#8221; bike ride of the season today (on the road bike, not the bike in the picture). It was good to get out. I went through town, out (and up!</description>
