      <description>A relaxed day in and near town. The morning consisted of some errands (buy postcards, scan documents for closing, buy a couple presents, some groceries, drop clothing off at the launderette). Lunch was sandwiches from the Scottish Deli. After lunch, we hiked through the Black Spout wood to reach the smallest distillery in Scotland &amp;#8211; Edradour.
We watched a video, took a tour and bought some gift-Scotch and some personal Scotch.</description>

      <description>Sam has been exploring what it means to be alive. We tell her trees are alive, but rocks aren&amp;#8217;t. Flowers are alive, but cars aren&amp;#8217;t. I&amp;#8217;ve been using growth as a proxy for life when Sam asks &amp;#8220;Why aren&amp;#8217;t cars alive?&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Are trucks alive?&amp;#8221;
We were going through some of this today eating out on the patio of &amp;#8220;House of Curries&amp;#8221; on Solano Ave in Berkeley (or is it still Albany there?</description>

      <description>Sometimes, product packaging has it just right.
Truth in advertising  Carolyn and I both like pistachios. But I like pistachio pudding, and Carolyn does not. I have a theory as to why &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s the color. I ate (and liked) pistachio pudding as a kid. It was yummy pudding, it was green, and you know, there were nuts in it, but no big deal. I just thought &amp;#8220;pistachio&amp;#8221; was a flavor of pudding &amp;#8212; sort of just a synonym for &amp;#8220;green.</description>

      <description>I was reading on The long tail, the blog authored by the editor-in-chief of Wired magazine, that he doesn&amp;#8217;t visit mainstream media sites directly any more. He gets all of his news filtered through a select (but large) group of bloggers, figuring that if it mattered, it would get blogged about, and so he&amp;#8217;d come across it. I had a friend and office-mate that treated a few mailing lists that way.</description>

      <title>Favorite (Mixed) Drink</title>
      <link>https://blog.accapehart.com/2005/09/favorite-mixed-drink/</link>

      <description>My current favorite mixed drink is the Irish Monk &amp;#8212; at least the recipe found in the &amp;#8220;Ultimate Bartender&amp;#8217;s Guide&amp;#8221;. It&amp;#8217;s a simple drink, which is part of why I like it. Easy to mix means less time screwing around, and more time drinking.
 2 oz. Jameson Irish Whiskey
2 oz. Frangelico
Pour Whiskey and Frangelico into glass filled with ice. Stir.
 It goes down smooth with the Frangelico cutting the whiskey and giving its own nutty flavor to the drink.</description>
