      <description>I am fair at keeping Linked In up to date. I&amp;#8217;m recently rejuvenated on facebook (now that they let me have &amp;#8220;AC Capehart&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; I had to get special permission to get past their error: &amp;#8220;too many capital letters.&amp;#8221;) I&amp;#8217;m woefully out of date in Sam&amp;#8217;s newsletters, but Carolyn has given me notes at least for a big blow-out for year 3 which is right around the corner. I see that even twitter is way behind.</description>

      <description>I am a couple of months behind in reading Wired, and just came across Clive Thomson&amp;#8217;s article on Twitter. Anyone who follows me (OK, just Yoz) knows how infrequently I update.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#8217;s about like this blog.&amp;nbsp; There are two bits of it that struck a chord with me:
 Productivity guru Tim Ferriss calls Twitter &amp;#8220;pointless email on steroids.&amp;#8221;
 I had a very similar reaction to it when I first stumbled across it.</description>

      <description>Well, as you can see from the sidebar change, I added &amp;#8220;Now Reading&amp;#8221; rather than writing my own. That&amp;#8217;s OK. I&amp;#8217;ll find something else to geek out on soon enough. I&amp;#8217;m wondering if I should generalize it to &amp;#8220;Now Consuming&amp;#8221; and add DVD&amp;#8217;s we&amp;#8217;re watching and games I&amp;#8217;m playing.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m such a Shiny whore.&amp;nbsp; I was working on a love machine (in python and django which I still quite like).&amp;nbsp; I got pretty far along, but got stuck on how to deal with the creation and management of groups and let it drop.&amp;nbsp; Carolyn just posted an entry about books we&amp;#8217;re reading, and I&amp;#8217;d seen other bloggers (like dadblog) whom I&amp;#8217;ve not read in ages (sorry Joe) who have a little books sidebar.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A good friend of mine has (re-)entered the blog-o-sphere with a blog named &lt;a href=&#34;http://beauframe.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;beauframe&lt;/a&gt;. He starts with a subway story. I recommend you &lt;a href=&#34;http://beauframe.blogspot.com/2006/07/her-name-is-africa.html&#34;&gt;read it first&lt;/a&gt;. His telling of his experience reminded me to blog a somewhat related subway (BART) experience I had recently.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Sorry I&amp;#8217;ve been so quiet recently. I actually have a few things to say, but have been having trouble focusing on this. Partly because of busy (baby still = handful, + clients, etc.), also because there&amp;#8217;s some stuff going on that I can&amp;#8217;t blog yet. I hate when that happens because I feel like it blocks up the rest of my creativity as well.
Anyway, the only real reason for this entry is to mention that there are a bunch of new pictures up of the world&amp;#8217;s cutest baby.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been meme tagged, and I&amp;#8217;m never sure what to do with those. I was just going to silently ignore it except when I told my wife that, she said, &amp;#8220;Aww, I was looking forward to what you were going say.&amp;#8221; So, now I&amp;#8217;m doing it. Kinda.

      <description>When I was growing up, I didn&amp;#8217;t have to worry about what my parents wrote about me. Neither of them wrote much. OK, my mom&amp;#8217;s great about letters and cards, and my dad&amp;#8217;s pretty good about postcards from key locations, or travel events. And I know my mom journals. But that kind of communication is, I think, fundamentally different from the public forum of blogging. As I continue to be a daddy blogger, I pay attention to others of the same ilk.</description>

      <description>I have just finished my first WordPress plugin. If you&amp;#8217;ve noticed Sam&amp;#8217;s age popping up at the bottom of posts in the Childhood &amp;amp; Fatherhood category, that&amp;#8217;s my plugin at work. If you&amp;#8217;ve noticed pages not acting quite right, well, that&amp;#8217;s my plugin when it wasn&amp;#8217;t working. ðŸ™‚
I think I&amp;#8217;ve gotten it all fixed up now, and am releasing it to the relatively small community of people who read my blog.</description>

  Man, you really never know what you&amp;#8217;re going to get from Amazon.com.
In reality, this is a test-post from within flickr. I&amp;#8217;ve joined recently, and started playing around. Now I&amp;#8217;ll have 3 levels of pictures. Everything I take is on my hard drive. Things that I think worth sharing at all will be in my gallery and things that I think are quite good and may deserve a larger audience will show up in my flickr stream.</description>

      <description>It was one year ago today that I started blogging. This would be a good time for self-reflection on what&amp;#8217;s changed in the past year. However, one of the things that&amp;#8217;s changed in the past year, has me up at 3:00 AM warming up formula to feed her, and so I&amp;#8217;m too woozy from need of sleep to be introspective. Maybe something more appropriate will come to me during nap time later in the day.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;#8217;t think he reads my blog, at least not with any regularity, but yesterday my brother-in-law IM&amp;#8217;ed me this URL: a newsgroup I posted to in 1991, in which I discuss a variety of topics from the LPMud I was helping run at the time, to the future of VR, to teledildonics &amp;#8212; all on a thread started by Howard Rheingold.

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s been a while since I&amp;#8217;ve stumbled across something on the web that made me chuckle quite like &amp;#8220;stuff on my cat&amp;#8221;. I was looking for new themes for wordpress, because when I get stuck on what I&amp;#8217;m working on, it&amp;#8217;s easier to fantasize about how my blog could look than fix whatever is stumping me at the moment. One link lead to another lead to stuff on my cat. Of course, they claim to be mentioned in GQ and several other magazines, so it&amp;#8217;s hardly a discovery.</description>

      <description>I had been using wordpress as managed by the Ubuntu package management system. This had caused a little bit of trouble because of the way it handled (or didn&amp;#8217;t handle) multiple installations. It more recently became even more trouble because it has PHP4 as a requirement, but I wanted to install something else that had PHP5 as a requirement. I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure that wordpress will do just fine under PHP5, but it would have been auto-un-installed with the move from PHP4 to PHP5.</description>

The new stuff begins on &amp;#8220;page 4&amp;#8221;:http://gallery2.accapehart.com/v/People/babycapehart/?g2_page=4 .
Also, a friend of mine who&amp;#8217;s also a Live Journal user has set up a LJ version of my blog feed. That way, LJ users can read it from within LJ, and even &amp;#8220;friend&amp;#8221; it for easier access. The Live Journal URL for this blog is:

      <description>I was at PSU Altoona recently running errands and managed to see a few people. I was impressed by the number of people who are up to date on what&amp;#8217;s going on with Carolyn, Sam and myself based on reading my blog. It&amp;#8217;s still disarming when there are people in France (Salut Peggy, Salut Tara) who know more details about the birth of my child than my own parents. I am also amused by who does and doesn&amp;#8217;t read my blog on campus.</description>

      <guid>https://blog.accapehart.com/2005/09/tempted-to-start/</guid>
      <description>There are a couple of things I&amp;#8217;m tempted to do/start with this blog. The first is to make it my home page. I don&amp;#8217;t think there&amp;#8217;s any content on the home page that&amp;#8217;s not (or couldn&amp;#8217;t be) on this page. And why come to a mostly dead home page when the life is going on underneith?
I&amp;#8217;m also tempted to start a section (or at least a category) called &amp;#8220;Other people&amp;#8217;s stories.</description>
