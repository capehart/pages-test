      <description>Camping   &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; There&amp;amp;#8217;s something magic to camping. The quiet sounds of nature still louder than the faint hum of the distant city. The s&amp;amp;#8217;mores fire next to me radiating dwindling heat and light. The redwoods arcing overhead painting inky shadows against the sky lit with the glow of stars and the city both close and far. I&amp;amp;#8217;m glad to be sharing it with Sam who I hear tossing and turning in the tent, sleepless from the novelty.</description>

      <description>Sam got her first &amp;#8220;bicycle&amp;#8221; today. We got her a &amp;#8220;balance bike&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;walking bike&amp;#8221;. We&amp;#8217;d looked around and found some pretty good deals on amazon, but we wanted to try it out in the shop before making a purchase like that. So we went to a few different bike shops including Performance that didn&amp;#8217;t have any. We wound up at &amp;#8220;Mike&amp;#8217;s Bikes&amp;#8221; where they had a few from Specialized. Sam was really cute as she skuut&amp;#8217;ed around the store on it, making &amp;#8220;ch&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;ch&amp;#8221; sounds.</description>

I don&amp;amp;#8217;t know what to say. Two years. The changes day to day, subtle, but occasionally exciting. The changes from month to month, certainly noteworthy as indicated by the monthly newsletters &amp;amp;#8212; yes, I owe you another one today! The changes year to year, astonishing.</description>

      <title>Trying Flock, Sliding Sam</title>

      <description>At SIGGRAPH, one of the area chiefs for the Guerilla Studio raved about Flock, so I thought I&amp;#8217;d try it out.&amp;nbsp; This is a post initiated from within Flock on the &amp;#8220;Post to my blog&amp;#8221; button.
Also, a little Sam update.&amp;nbsp; Today, she did two new slides by herself at the playground at Canyon Oak Trail.&amp;nbsp; One tall and twisty, the other shorter but steep and enclosed, aka &amp;#8220;the tunnel.&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp; Previously, she&amp;#8217;d refused to do this without holding someone&amp;#8217;s hand and since neither is at all conducive to hand-holding, she&amp;#8217;d simply not done either before.</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;ve had a potty in the bathroom for a few weeks now. We give her praise for sitting on it, but mostly ignore it. We&amp;#8217;ve sat her on it in a way she could actually make use of it a few times before, but nothing&amp;#8217;s come of it. Today on the way to the bath (she traverses the house naked from the living room to the bathroom,) she asked for the potty and went to sit on it.</description>

      <description>Sam has really started taking off with the walking. Only a little bit of it is unsupported, but finger walking has come quite a long way in a short amount of time.
Last week, Mom and Sam came into the city so that Mom could get some new glasses. Sam and I had lunch in a park near the office. A passerby noted &amp;#8220;You two look like such a picture there.</description>

      <description>It was a year ago now, that Samantha Fay Capehart came into the world. I&amp;#8217;m amazed at all that&amp;#8217;s happened in the past year &amp;#8212; so many changes in our lives. I&amp;#8217;ll try to wax poetic about them soon, but in the meanwhile, I wanted to wish you a
Happy Birthday, Samantha!</description>

      <description>This morning on the floor of the offices of Fay Real Estate, Sam executed her first forward crawl on hands and knees. She was going after one of Camus&amp;#8217;s catnip toys.
Camus and I are very afraid&amp;#8230;</description>

      <description>I think it was yesterday, maybe it was the day before &amp;#8212; time gets so lost right now &amp;#8212; when Sam made the half of the (stereo-)typical baby noise. She said &amp;#8220;Ga&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; Now all we need is a &amp;#8220;Goo&amp;#8221; to go with it, and we&amp;#8217;ll be set!
Also, people are coming tomorrow to see the house! It&amp;#8217;s still not in great shape, but mostly it&amp;#8217;s just clutter. I&amp;#8217;ve finished the work I want to do to it (mostly thanks to the family helping out last weekend.</description>

      <description>Sam had a nice, long, unsupported sit today. Maybe 30-45 seconds. Mom and dad were impressed.</description>

      <description>We did it. And it was at least a moderate success. Sam had her first non-milk, non-formula food today! We mixed up some rice cereal with formula, and fed it to her with a spoon. A real (baby) spoon! It&amp;#8217;s hard to tell how much she actually took, as a great deal of it landed on her bib, her clothes, her parents, her chair, her floor, etc. (Not really all that bad.</description>

      <title>“Roll it” addendum</title>
      <link>https://blog.accapehart.com/2006/01/roll-it-addendum/</link>

      <description>I didn&amp;#8217;t track the first time she did this, but it&amp;#8217;s also of note that Sam has supported her own weight on her legs, and has been doing so for at least a week. She&amp;#8217;ll &amp;#8220;stand&amp;#8221; up in our laps. I can hold her just above her waist, helping with core balance a little, but she can do all of the standing herself. I think if she just weren&amp;#8217;t so top-heavy with her head, she could probably stand briefly on her own.</description>

      <title>Roll it on over</title>

      <description>Sam rolled over twice today from the much-despised tummy time on to her back. She is 15 weeks old today. I went to get the camera to capture the third time, but there was no third time. Instead, I recorded a couple minutes of a child fussing because she didn&amp;#8217;t want to have to lift that heave head one more time. Or, maybe it was performance anxiety.</description>
