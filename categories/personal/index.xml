      <description>I do some of my best thinking in the shower. Or at least it feels like it while I&amp;#8217;m in the shower. ðŸ™‚ But, if ever there were a guilty pleasure of mine, it&amp;#8217;s a long, hot shower. Both the water required and the power required to heat that water are a wasteful luxury. As I was musing this over in the shower this morning, it occurred to me that most of this waste is because the water going down the drain that is still &amp;#8220;mostly hot&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;mostly clean.</description>

      <description>This morning, I had a simple, but I think profound realization. Wealth creation is not a zero-sum game. For me to be wealthier, I do not need to make you poorer. Now, I&amp;#8217;ve known this before. You probably have too. But sometimes it feels like it, because of the exchange of money, and the erroneous conflation of money with wealth.
Wealth has been in the back of my mind for some time.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was thinking recently of things I&amp;#8217;ve done, places I&amp;#8217;ve been. At forty, I still feel young. New to the world, even though my body isn&amp;#8217;t capable of what it once was. Looking back though, I&amp;#8217;m astonished and overwhelmed at the people and events that have found their way into my lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes at Thanksgiving, the holiday has just come and gone. Good food, good friends and family. This year, though I spent a little bit of time reflecting. I count myself genuinely lucky for the breadth of experiences I&amp;#8217;ve had, people I&amp;#8217;ve known, places I&amp;#8217;ve been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>If you can&amp;#8217;t say anything nice, don&amp;#8217;t say anything at all.
 I don&amp;#8217;t recall if that was formally part of my upbringing, but for the most part, I take it to heart. I&amp;#8217;ve been pretty quiet lately.
In part, it seems to be the norm for social media too. It&amp;#8217;s OK to be momentarily frustrated by something, or to need help with a task, but if it&amp;#8217;s not funny, engaging, or a bit of over-sharing, it doesn&amp;#8217;t belong in your tweet or your facebook update.</description>

      <description>I came across an interesting &amp;#8220;installation&amp;#8221; today at MIT. I think someone I follow tweeted it. It was interesting to me how it categorized my presence. The big bars were &amp;#8220;online&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;management&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;education&amp;#8221;. &amp;#8220;sports&amp;#8221; is bigger than it has any right to be. It was interesting to see some of the things it grabbed. References to me from former professors, test emails to lists I set up while at IATH, my &amp;#8220;temporary&amp;#8221; home page.</description>

      <description>In an effort to preserve the artifacts of childhood without the artifacts of childhood, Carolyn and I have been trying to preserve Sam&amp;#8217;s efforts digitally.
The Poem   &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; I came home after work one day recently, and at some point in the evening, out of the blue, Sam says: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; &amp;amp;#8220;I wrote you a poem daddy. I left it on your bedside table. You can read it when you go to bed.</description>

      <description>I woke from a weird dream this morning. A new colleague (who doesn&amp;#8217;t really exist) was objecting to some work that I wanted to do that would leverage the cloud and improve the user experience because it would &amp;#8220;cause more workload.&amp;#8221; Some time later, we&amp;#8217;re at a webdev meeting and I realize I&amp;#8217;m the supervisor of all these people and the team is so large it&amp;#8217;s unwieldy. Someone higher up in the organization is talking to us about something that&amp;#8217;s not particularly engaging.</description>
