      <description>We&amp;#8217;ve been making an &amp;#8220;outgoing&amp;#8221; chart to help Sam, in social situations, to be more, well, social. She&amp;#8217;s been doing a good job, and recently completed said chart so as a reward, we&amp;#8217;re going to Fairyland in Oakland. This morning, we were talking about the day and she said she was going to go as a fairy. Because it&amp;#8217;s fairy land. Mom asked what Mom and Dad should go as.</description>

      <description>Sam got her first &amp;#8220;bicycle&amp;#8221; today. We got her a &amp;#8220;balance bike&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;walking bike&amp;#8221;. We&amp;#8217;d looked around and found some pretty good deals on amazon, but we wanted to try it out in the shop before making a purchase like that. So we went to a few different bike shops including Performance that didn&amp;#8217;t have any. We wound up at &amp;#8220;Mike&amp;#8217;s Bikes&amp;#8221; where they had a few from Specialized. Sam was really cute as she skuut&amp;#8217;ed around the store on it, making &amp;#8220;ch&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;ch&amp;#8221; sounds.</description>

      <description>Sam and I were looking at a map of the UK and Ireland and I asked if she knew who comes from Ireland? She didn&amp;#8217;t know that that&amp;#8217;s where her (great-)aunt Janet is from, so we talked about that. She asked where her (great-)aunt Scotties is from, and I said &amp;#8220;Richmond, where Grand-mÃ¨re lives now.&amp;#8221; The following conversation ensued:
 Sam: Daddy, I&amp;#8217;ve got a new country coming.
Dad: Oh? What&amp;#8217;s the name of the new country?</description>

      <description>Sam has been exploring what it means to be alive. We tell her trees are alive, but rocks aren&amp;#8217;t. Flowers are alive, but cars aren&amp;#8217;t. I&amp;#8217;ve been using growth as a proxy for life when Sam asks &amp;#8220;Why aren&amp;#8217;t cars alive?&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Are trucks alive?&amp;#8221;
We were going through some of this today eating out on the patio of &amp;#8220;House of Curries&amp;#8221; on Solano Ave in Berkeley (or is it still Albany there?</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been mentioning Sam&amp;#8217;s stories recently. Mom just read Sam a draft of another children&amp;#8217;s story, and now Sam is &amp;#8220;writing&amp;#8221; and telling stories. The most recent one is something about how when Mommy was a little girl and Sam was a bigger girl and there was a fox in the woods and we made it to the top of big rock candy mountain. (She&amp;#8217;s also been listening to the soundtrack of &amp;#8220;O Brother, Where Art Thou?</description>
