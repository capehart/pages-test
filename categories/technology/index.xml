      <description>Or &amp;#8220;How to proofread a job posting&amp;#8221;.
I came across this posting on the python group I&amp;#8217;m a member of on (in?) Linked In.
The first typo, was a bit awkward, but I could see how it would happen during an editing/revision session when that session wasn&amp;#8217;t followed by a proofreading. &amp;#8220;Our client is a leader in the worldwide leader&amp;#8221;. So, what you&amp;#8217;re saying is they lead?
But what actually cracked me up was the simple substitution of a &amp;#8220;t&amp;#8221; where a &amp;#8220;d&amp;#8221; should go.</description>

 I just wrote how much better my very fast internet is. However, things are not looking so rosy right now. 27% packet los to my upstream router is not so good.</description>

      <description>I have two really smart friends who are building MailRank. I don&amp;#8217;t know more than they&amp;#8217;ve posted online or made inferences from their name, but I think they are trying to make email distinguish between the stuff you do care about (mail from your spouse) and stuff that&amp;#8217;s not spam, but you don&amp;#8217;t care about (mail from the bike shop, mail from your mom). If it works (and, to be sure, I&amp;#8217;ve got no idea how it possibly could), I&amp;#8217;d love to get a &amp;#8220;biff&amp;#8221; style notification of &amp;#8220;mail I do care about&amp;#8221;!</description>

      <description>After much humming and hawing, I signed up for broadband in Virginia with Comcast. I&amp;#8217;m wary of them based on their filtering, and other subscribers talking about their dropping idle connections (sometimes, long-lived SSH connections are handy). But I wasn&amp;#8217;t able to get much bandwidth from CenturyLink due to my location. So far, speedtest looks downright awesome. Here are the results from my new connection in Virginia.
Here&amp;#8217;s what I get at the inlaws office where I&amp;#8217;m working now.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;#8217;t count how many times I have looked on the back of a photograph hoping the photographer wrote down who those people are, or when or where the photo was taken. Well, it would actually be a fairly small number, but boy is it annoying when you want the data and it just isn&amp;#8217;t there. Digital cameras will almost always automatically embed date information for you (and if not, then the software you pick them up with will!</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m trying to simplify my computer network for my upcoming move, and so far, it&amp;#8217;s been going pretty well. I think we&amp;#8217;ll be able to run with just the D-Link DIR-655 (192.168.1.1) feeding a network with my new ReadyNas NV+ (192.168.1.3) acting as a central file store, iTunes server and Time Machine backup device. And we&amp;#8217;ll have a couple of MacBook Pros connecting either wired or wirelessly. In the meanwhile, we&amp;#8217;ve got a few other devices on the net including a printer, the old audiotron, etc.</description>

      <description>I came across an interesting &amp;#8220;installation&amp;#8221; today at MIT. I think someone I follow tweeted it. It was interesting to me how it categorized my presence. The big bars were &amp;#8220;online&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;management&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;education&amp;#8221;. &amp;#8220;sports&amp;#8221; is bigger than it has any right to be. It was interesting to see some of the things it grabbed. References to me from former professors, test emails to lists I set up while at IATH, my &amp;#8220;temporary&amp;#8221; home page.</description>

      <description>Had a nice, if somewhat hot, day out motorcycling with Frank, formerly of Linden Lab, now of Aquarium of the Bay. Wandered the far east bay. Wound up again at Port Costa. Had drinks and a sandwich there. Watched trains and tankers and tugs. Talked. Thought. Threw rocks into the Carquinez Straight. Came back through Crockett (whence came &amp;#8220;The Rocket From Crockett&amp;#8220;) and got home around 6 PM.
The last leg was really interesting from a meteorological perspective.</description>

      <description>Maker Faire!   &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The three of us went to the Maker Faire ((Carolyn especially enjoyed the spelling of &amp;amp;#8220;Faire&amp;amp;#8221; as it&amp;amp;#8217;s the French infinitive of &amp;amp;#8220;to do&amp;amp;#8221; or &amp;amp;#8220;to make&amp;amp;#8221;! )) today. I was ambivalent about going originally as it seemed like it would be a bit of a hassle to get there. Originally, it was going to be only Sam and myself going, but as Carolyn helped us figure out how best to get there, she decided it looked interesting to her too, so we decided to all go.</description>

      <description>Something has happened at work that has caused me a certain amount of anxiety. In response to that, I decided I really needed a pet project. I still don&amp;#8217;t know what that project was going to be, but there were a few technologies that I thought I&amp;#8217;d like to know better / play with. Specifically, Twisted, Stackless and RabbitMQ.
I got on to the ubuntu box that I host in the amazon cloud and started doing updates so that I had a current box to do some of the above installs on.</description>

      <description>Well, OK, she didn&amp;#8217;t write her name by herself today. This morning, we practiced together with pen and paper. I tried to get her to hold the pen &amp;#8220;properly&amp;#8221; but didn&amp;#8217;t get far with that. Her &amp;#8216;S&amp;#8217; looked like something between a &amp;#8220;d&amp;#8221; and a squared-off &amp;#8220;o&amp;#8221;. But later in the afternoon, I set her down in front of AlphaBaby, and I pointed out some of the letters, drew her name with stars, etc.</description>

      <description>I am a couple of months behind in reading Wired, and just came across Clive Thomson&amp;#8217;s article on Twitter. Anyone who follows me (OK, just Yoz) knows how infrequently I update.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#8217;s about like this blog.&amp;nbsp; There are two bits of it that struck a chord with me:
 Productivity guru Tim Ferriss calls Twitter &amp;#8220;pointless email on steroids.&amp;#8221;
 I had a very similar reaction to it when I first stumbled across it.</description>

      <description>Well, as you can see from the sidebar change, I added &amp;#8220;Now Reading&amp;#8221; rather than writing my own. That&amp;#8217;s OK. I&amp;#8217;ll find something else to geek out on soon enough. I&amp;#8217;m wondering if I should generalize it to &amp;#8220;Now Consuming&amp;#8221; and add DVD&amp;#8217;s we&amp;#8217;re watching and games I&amp;#8217;m playing.</description>

      <description>I wrote a long and detailed trip report on my recent SIGGRAPH trip for work.&amp;nbsp; I was figuring to simply copy-paste it here, but in review, it seems a little too Linden-centric, so over the next couple of days I&amp;#8217;ll try to figure out how best to excerpt it/restructure it to bring it out here.&amp;nbsp; I was embarrassed that Carolyn had (until just now) written my two most recent blog entries and even so they were a month apart.</description>

      <description>OK, I just learned that there&amp;#8217;s now a facebook application called &amp;#8220;the love machine&amp;#8221; which is quite similar to the one we use at work &amp;#8212; except that it&amp;#8217;s out there for everyone to use!
Curiously, it was created by Ooga Labs who have our CEO as an advisor (on their board?). As our CTO has said, (paraphrasing) &amp;#8220;Now that facebook has announced their API/platform, never build another in-house social networking app&amp;#8221;.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve spent a reasonable amount of time in each of Windows XP, Ubuntu and MacOS X for desktop computing, and I have all three available to me right now. But mostly, I find myself in the MacOS. Partly this is a machine issue &amp;#8212; the Intel box that dual boots XP/Ubuntu I built years ago and sounds like&amp;#8230; well like someone who wanted to put a lot of hardware in and so needed a lot of fans.</description>

      <description>The Go-Kart racing. That was fun, but I&amp;#8217;m still sore. A bunch of Lindens went down to Burlingame, CA where we went to GoKart Racer Where you do the racing (I guess at other GoKart places, your mom does the racing?)
There were roughly 30 of us there for racing. The sign-in process wasn&amp;#8217;t bad, but was a little slow as we all had to go through a process for which there are a few computers, and of course we arrived as a bunch.</description>

      <description>I wanted to jot down some quick notes as I play Second Life about the nature of online relationships. As I started to write, I felt like I needed to include a little back story. Writing this intro paragraph, I realize that already what follows is too long for a single blog post, and I&amp;#8217;m not even out of the back story yet. That said, I&amp;#8217;m not going to break it up further.</description>

If you&amp;#8217;ve noticed Sam&amp;#8217;s age popping up at the bottom of posts in the Childhood &amp;amp; Fatherhood category, that&amp;#8217;s my plugin at work. If you&amp;#8217;ve noticed pages not acting quite right, well, that&amp;#8217;s my plugin when it wasn&amp;#8217;t working. ðŸ™‚
I think I&amp;#8217;ve gotten it all fixed up now, and am releasing it to the relatively small community of people who read my blog.</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;ve taken some grief recently over SamTrak. People seem to think it&amp;#8217;s a bit beyond the pale to be tracking Sam&amp;#8217;s feeding and elimination habits on the Internet. But, there is reason to my madness. Because of her size, we needed to track feeding and elimination. Because it&amp;#8217;s me, it seemed easiest to do this online (access from any computer instead of &amp;#8220;Where&amp;#8217;s the little black poop notebook?&amp;#8221;). Now, I could have done it on my private house-network, but then Carolyn couldn&amp;#8217;t have accessed the information from work.</description>

      <description>In response to this query, I ended up with a 15&amp;#8243; powerbook. It&amp;#8217;s a pretty sweet machine even if they did just replace it with the &amp;#8220;4-times more powerful MacBook.&amp;#8221; I tried an Ubuntu install, but it failed to recognize the Superdrive as a source for the CD &amp;#8212; apparently Apple made some change to the drive with the October(&amp;#8217;05) model updates. There&amp;#8217;s a patch in Gentoo, but not (yet?) in Ubuntu.</description>

      <description>I tend to think of the server that my in-laws use for their business: http://www.fayrealestate.com/ as falling in the same category as my other &amp;#8220;personal&amp;#8221; machines &amp;#8212; like the one that hosts this blog, and http://www.santaal.com/ and so forth. I need to start thinking of them as clients instead.
Yesterday, they were having some trouble. I did some investigation and found that a awstats vulnerability had been exploited. I was sure I&amp;#8217;d password-protected the awstats pages, but when I looked through the apache configs, I found no such thing.</description>

      <description>This is a geeky post. Non-geeks may safely skip over this post and still have a full breadth of understanding of my life (and Sam&amp;#8217;s, and to a lesser extent Carolyn&amp;#8217;s), or at least as full a one as can be had from this blog.
There, now that that&amp;#8217;s out of the way, let me fill you in on what&amp;#8217;s up. I&amp;#8217;ve seen a few blogs (mostly LJ, but some others) that have a &amp;#8220;mood&amp;#8221; emoticon, and a little &amp;#8220;What I&amp;#8217;m listening to&amp;#8221; bar wherein users can type in the tunes they are currently jamming to.</description>

      <description>I had been using wordpress as managed by the Ubuntu package management system. This had caused a little bit of trouble because of the way it handled (or didn&amp;#8217;t handle) multiple installations. It more recently became even more trouble because it has PHP4 as a requirement, but I wanted to install something else that had PHP5 as a requirement. I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure that wordpress will do just fine under PHP5, but it would have been auto-un-installed with the move from PHP4 to PHP5.</description>

      <description>If I get paid for some recent work, I think I&amp;#8217;ll have enough dough for a new computer. This is good because while I have a fleet of computers, they&amp;#8217;re all old and getting older. My newest one is about 3 years old &amp;#8212; about the usable lifespan of a computer. I&amp;#8217;m trying to decide what computer to get next and am soliciting your input.
So far in my life, I&amp;#8217;ve never purchased a laptop for myself.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve heard from a couple of people now that they&amp;#8217;ve had trouble accessing Samantha&amp;#8217;s website, or SamTrak from her site. I suspect DNS trouble. I set these sorts of things up with some regularity, so I should have a pretty good idea of what to do. Alas, I usually do it on more sleep than I had recently, so I could have screwed something up. It all works for me, but I use my own DNS servers.</description>

      <description>Gallery 2.0 was released yesterday. At least, I got mail about it at 11:04 PM yesterday. Generally, I&amp;#8217;m not a &amp;#8220;dot-oh&amp;#8221; person. I&amp;#8217;m a pretty strong believer in letting others live on the bleeding edge. And while Gallery 2.0, is certainly a &amp;#8220;dot-oh&amp;#8221;, I suspect it&amp;#8217;s pretty well tested having been in design and development for 3 years through through 4 alpha releases, 4 beta releases and 2 release candidates. So, I&amp;#8217;ve created gallery2.</description>

      <description>Thanks to the Neon Guild I was just exposed to an exceptional article on computer (and network) security. The article is well-written, easy to read, and an important reminder to anyone that administers a network. Author Marcus Ranum is recognized as the inventor of the proxy firewall, and the implementor of the first commercial firewall product, and it&amp;#8217;s quite pleasant to come across a technologist who is readable in print. I&amp;#8217;m going to add this link to My Wiki as well, as it is doubtless something I&amp;#8217;ll need to re-read every few months.</description>

Which, as I&amp;#8217;m sure you know is important to my revenue plans for this site. I&amp;#8217;ve earned an average of a little over 43 cents every month since I started Adsense. Of course, they don&amp;#8217;t cut a check until you&amp;#8217;ve accumulcated a credit of $100. At this rate, I&amp;#8217;ll get my first check in 19.</description>

      <description>I spent far too much of today copying the old blogger entries into wordpress. I suspect it was still faster than writing a parser to scan previous entries and dump them into the mysql database that wordpress uses, though I&amp;#8217;m not sure. The main thing that I&amp;#8217;ve not done is to move over the image-only posts. Oh, and figure out comments. There were several nice and interesting comments that elaborated on entries that will be lost with the current transition.</description>

      <description>When the web was infantile, there was no real way to know what was new. During its toddler stage, information about new websites was passed around via email or on USENET. Eventually, there became too many sites being created for this to be a reasonable way to keep up. (A similar issue plagued the single /etc/hosts file, but that&amp;#8217;s a different story.)
Finally, there came Yahoo. Now, there was a directory for the web.</description>

      <description>Joe, the author of Dadblog &amp;#8212; one of the 2 blogs that I read where I don&amp;#8217;t know the author &amp;#8212; wrote to me today. Apparently, he was looking through his web log analysis software, and saw a referrer he didn&amp;#8217;t recognize (my blog). He checked me out and correctly deduced that we have a common friend in Clinton.
This spurred me to check my own logs. 
Almost everything was as I expected but for 2 things:</description>

The first time, submitting the completed post to Blogger, I got a server error page. Pressing the back button, I was faced with an empty page.
This time, I was looking for a web image of a Suzuki GS 550 ES (the first bike I bought), and clicking back in a separate tab caused FIREFOX on LINUX to just disappear.</description>

There is a designer in the Neon Guild1who is proposing to do a site for a client. The designer talked to Jack about doing internationalization for the client. Jack talked to me. I experimented with it (here) to make sure I knew what I&amp;#8217;d do.</description>

      <description>So, I started playing around more with Ruby on Rails (RoR) recently. I&amp;#8217;m seriously impressed. There&amp;#8217;s an excellent tutorial available that walks you through making a todo list application via rails.
I&amp;#8217;ve done a fair amount of CGI programming in Python. And a good bit of Java servlet application programming. Neither feels as natural as RoR. I feel like once I actually have a better handle on both the Ruby language itself, and the Rails framework, I&amp;#8217;ll be able to pump out database-supported web applications quickly and with a minimum of fuss.</description>

It&amp;#8217;s off, or inaccessible, or I&amp;#8217;ve got to pair it again, or&amp;#8230; it&amp;#8217;s always something. And given the choice between that, and some cold, hard cash in my paypal account&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;m going for the dough.
So, treat yourself to a Bluetooth headset.</description>

Well, that was frustrating. After my friend was cracked, I decided that it would be smart to keep my web content in a revision control system. That way, when some malicious cracker replaced all of my index files with self-congratulatory tripe, all I&amp;#8217;d really need to do would be to restore from the repository.</description>

      <description>This morning, I was feeling pretty good about myself. I was reviewing a Java Web Services Tutorial and it was making sense. I tried the examples, and with a little bit of classpath fudging, I got them to work. I tried a quote generator I found on xmethods.com and got it to work. I was impressed with myself. Then I looked through the &amp;#8220;additional resources&amp;#8221; section at the end and found my way to a book on XML-RPC.</description>

      <description>On a lighter note, I applied for Google AdSense ads today for the blog. I have no idea if they&amp;#8217;ll take it, and I&amp;#8217;m sure I don&amp;#8217;t have the readership to actually generate enough money to care about. But, I thought I&amp;#8217;d try it.
I mention this partly because I think it&amp;#8217;s noteworthy. But what cracked me up was when I found the online version of the Wired print article concerning the postal monopoly for my previous blog entry, I saw that the wired article also had Google AdSense ads.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m writing this after the fact (by a couple of days) instead of as it was intended (by a couple of hours). Still interesting (to me).
I&amp;#8217;m on a vacation of sorts, in Southern Maryland, or SOMD as I&amp;#8217;ve taken to calling it1. I decided not to bring my laptop because I had a certain confidence there would be no Internet connectivity where we were staying. My cell phone broke, so today, I&amp;#8217;m really disconnected.</description>

      <description>For those that don&amp;#8217;t know, Google&amp;#8217;s now offering a webmail service. The &amp;#8220;advantage&amp;#8221; to google&amp;#8217;s mail is that you get a gig of storage, and you get google&amp;#8217;s search interface to your stuff. The idea being &amp;#8212; why bother to trash stuff or sort/organize it. Just archive it all and search for what you need. Maybe that&amp;#8217;ll work. I dunno.
But, since &amp;#8220;gmail&amp;#8221; is still in &amp;#8220;beta&amp;#8221;, it&amp;#8217;s by invitation only.</description>

      <description>I had written something like this earlier, but it disappeared into the ether with a 500 Error from blogger.com. What follows is a re-creation, doubtless somewhat more organized, but less impassioned than the original.)
I don&amp;#8217;t like folding laundry. And I don&amp;#8217;t understand folding proteins. But, thanks to Folding@Home I&amp;#8217;m now doing my part toward their goal to understand protein folding, protein aggregation, and related diseases. But, it&amp;#8217;s not the hidden-bio-geek in me that&amp;#8217;s enjoying this.</description>

      <description>OK, I kinda meant to have complained, or at least thought (in the blog) about money, job, life etc. But that just hasn&amp;#8217;t come up as strongly as it could have in the past few days. I&amp;#8217;m sure one will come soon though.
But today I want to rant. I guess this is kind of a rant about job because if I were in an office with other geeks, especially other linux admin/java geeks, I might just get answers to my problems instead of having to google them (with limited success.</description>
