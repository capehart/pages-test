      <description>I woke from a weird dream this morning. A new colleague (who doesn&amp;#8217;t really exist) was objecting to some work that I wanted to do that would leverage the cloud and improve the user experience because it would &amp;#8220;cause more workload.&amp;#8221; Some time later, we&amp;#8217;re at a webdev meeting and I realize I&amp;#8217;m the supervisor of all these people and the team is so large it&amp;#8217;s unwieldy. Someone higher up in the organization is talking to us about something that&amp;#8217;s not particularly engaging.</description>
