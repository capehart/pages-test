      <description>This morning, I had a simple, but I think profound realization. Wealth creation is not a zero-sum game. For me to be wealthier, I do not need to make you poorer. Now, I&amp;#8217;ve known this before. You probably have too. But sometimes it feels like it, because of the exchange of money, and the erroneous conflation of money with wealth.
Wealth has been in the back of my mind for some time.</description>

      <description>Because of the Second Life reference, I was pointed at this Boston Globe post.
I was amused by the following juxtaposition:
 &amp;#8230;there will be greater access to government, with online services to let anyone question members of the president&amp;#8217;s Cabinet or track every dime of the federal budget.
 &amp;#8230;
 Judging by the campaign&amp;#8217;s position paper on technology policy &amp;#8211; calls and e-mails to the Obama transition team were not returned &amp;#8211; the president-elect believes&amp;#8230;</description>

      <description>When I was a member of City Car Share, before my wife, daughter, furniture and car came out to join me in the bay area, I got to drive a Prius around. It was kinda cool. It could be erily quiet at stop lights, it got up to highway speed well enough, if occasionally hesitant. But one of the things that amused me most about it was a sticker on the window.</description>

      <description>Ever since my wife said she was thinking about getting me an iPod for father&amp;#8217;s day, but decided against it because it&amp;#8217;s too expensive, I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking about getting myself an iPod for father&amp;#8217;s day. I&amp;#8217;m about to have a much longer commute than before &amp;#8212; any time you have to get on the train, it&amp;#8217;s going to be a lot longer than the trip from the bedroom to the den!</description>

      <description>Yesterday, Sam got another birth card. This one (ostensibly) came from Governor Ed Rendell, and his wife, Midge. The front looks like a normal congratulatory card. The cover says &amp;#8220;Welcome Little One&amp;#8221; and on the inside, &amp;#8220;The world is one baby sweeter now.&amp;#8221; And then comes the &amp;#8220;personal&amp;#8221; message from Midge &amp;amp; Ed. In handwriting-font, it says &amp;#8220;As parents, we know how precious your baby is to you. Keeping your little one healthy means starting immunizations by two months of age.</description>

      <title>Christmas traditions</title>

      <description>Carolyn and I have started talking about what Christmas &amp;#8220;traditions&amp;#8221; we should start to institute. For that matter, we&amp;#8217;re also talking about how to present Christmas to baby Sam in the future. In many ways, despite the efforts of some true believers, Christmas has become as much a secular holiday as a religious one. As has been noted earlier, I&amp;#8217;m hardly a model Christian, despite agreeing with many of the stated (if not demonstrated) tenets of the faith.</description>

      <description>No, in this case, I&amp;#8217;m not talking about the BVM that so permeates Altoona. I&amp;#8217;m talking about the latest way to calm a crying baby. I think I mentioned in the most recent monthly newsletter that she likes when we dance to music. I tried Madonna. She loved it. She calmed immediately. I wonder how much this will embarrass her in the future?
And am I pleased or sad that this may embarrass her in the future?</description>

      <title>102% of Americans support Creationism</title>

      <description>According to &amp;#8220;this recent article&amp;#8221;:http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/31/national/31religion.html?incamp=article_popular in the New York times, I quote: &amp;#8220;In all, 64 percent said they were open to the idea of teaching creationism in addition to evolution, while 38 percent favored replacing evolution with creationism.&amp;#8221; I double-checked. 64+38 = 102.
I know what they meant of course. Still, it&amp;#8217;s interesting the slant. Also not surprising, but interestingly phrased: &amp;#8220;More of those who believe in creationism said they were &amp;#8220;very certain&amp;#8221; of their views (63 percent), compared with those who believe in evolution (32 percent).</description>

      <description>Bush quotes that got under my skin today:
&amp;#8220;Iran is ruled by men who suppress liberty at home and spread terror across the world.&amp;#8221;
This, from a man who suppresses liberty at home and spreads terror across the world!
NPR: &amp;#8220;Bush criticized the electoral process [in Iran] saying it is designed to keep power in the hands of the few.&amp;#8221; AC wonders who was the last US president that wasn&amp;#8217;t a millionaire.</description>

      <description>I read an interesting article that my mom sent me. She sent me the paper copy from the AARP bulletin that she (apparently) receives. The gist of the article (authored by Swarthmore professor Barry Schwartz) is that the free market is good at giving consumers choices, but an abundance of choices can cause decision paralysis and dissatisfaction. These are primarily afflictions suffered by &amp;#8220;maximizers&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; people who&amp;#8217;s goal in decision-making is to get &amp;#8220;the best&amp;#8221; as opposed to &amp;#8220;satisficers&amp;#8221; who&amp;#8217;s goal is to be satisfied.</description>

      <description>[I started this post trying to talk about free market vs. central planning in the realm of garbage collection in Altoona. It started out a little off-topic as I wanted to talk about the environment of discourse at PSU Altoona before delving into this specifically. It went wildly awry from there and never returned. I&amp;#8217;ll have to try again later.]
What kind of person actively listens to positions that they disagree with?</description>

      <description>I don&amp;#8217;t know why I take these quizzes really. Does it matter to me to know who my inner rock star is? Or how well I stack up against my peers in my successful distinction between there, they&amp;#8217;re and their? Still, I saw a quiz that asked which (witch? ðŸ˜‰ religion was right for me, and I took it.
I am amused to announce that I&amp;#8217;m a Satanist. I wonder if there&amp;#8217;s a checkbox for that on PSU&amp;#8217;s equal opportunity employment form somewhere.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;#8217;t acquire much news these days. However, I do still often wake to NPR. Today I heard part of an interesting story on comics. I&amp;#8217;d already been introduced to my Central PA neighbor Jay Hosler&amp;#8216;s work as well as the darwin collaboration that the story refers to by a comic book buddy and communications professor (all wrapped up in the same dude) on a bike ride together. I already knew that comics could have a profound impact on our thinking both culturally and individually.</description>

      <description>Already, I&amp;#8217;m glad I entered the Google AdSense program. I&amp;#8217;ve been crawled by googlebot a fair amount recently, but apparently, they still don&amp;#8217;t have enough info to put together real ads for my page(s). Instead, I can either run a background color (which I had been doing) or public service announcements for which I don&amp;#8217;t get paid. As you can see, as of this writing at least, I&amp;#8217;m now doing the latter.</description>

      <description>When I was a young &amp;#8216;en, maybe about 16, I lived in (two of) the poorer sections of the richest school district around. A school district my parents had moved into three years earlier &amp;#8211; and shortly before their divorce &amp;#8212; specifically so that I could go to the good county schools instead of the crappy city schools. All, in all, it was not bad. I got the fancy education, but I was not as insulated in my upper-crust world as other school-mates of mine.</description>

      <description>I just finished a book by Norma Jean Almodovar entitled Cop to Call Girl describing aspects of her two careers &amp;#8212; first as a traffic cop with the LAPD and subsequently as a call girl. And, to a lesser extent her activism concerning the decriminalization of consensual sex laws. I borrowed it from bk partly because I&amp;#8217;m moderately fascinated by sex work and those that do it and partly because it did seem like an unusual transition.</description>
