      <description>On Friday, it was supposed to rain. We were going to go shopping. I needed a replacement keychain &amp;#8211; my &amp;#8220;England&amp;#8221; one from Heathrow had broken under the strain of daily use. I needed a hat (CF my post wherein I left my hat on the train on the way up). I was interested in a sweater of Scottish wool. We have various birthdays coming up that we need to provide for.</description>

      <description>Thursday, we again had an excellent lie in, and a lazy breakfast in the cottage wherein we discussed what we might want to do. There were three hikes that I had in mind as possibilities. 1) The mountain we&amp;#8217;d skirted around on our Killiecrankie walk, 2) the loop near the top of the mountain we&amp;#8217;d traversed on our Strathtay walk or 3) further up the Tummel river to see &amp;#8220;Queen&amp;#8217;s View&amp;#8220;.</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;re back from another very nice, if somewhat wearying hike. This time, we walked &amp;#8220;over the hill&amp;#8221; from Pitlochry to Strathtay. The hike was nice, though

over Pitlochry  today, the boots weren&amp;#8217;t as magic, and Botticelli, while still engaging wasn&amp;#8217;t as thoroughly distracting as it was the day before. Therefore, we had a somewhat more recalcitrant hiker than a couple of days ago. Still, all things considered, I&amp;#8217;m pleased with her capability and willingness.</description>

      <description>A relaxed day in and near town. The morning consisted of some errands (buy postcards, scan documents for closing, buy a couple presents, some groceries, drop clothing off at the launderette). Lunch was sandwiches from the Scottish Deli. After lunch, we hiked through the Black Spout wood to reach the smallest distillery in Scotland &amp;#8211; Edradour.
We watched a video, took a tour and bought some gift-Scotch and some personal Scotch.</description>

      <description>Today, we hiked.
By the weather forecast, this looked to be the best day of the week, and as we were fresh, and came here to walk around, we set out for a hike.
We got off to a leisurely start. We had breakfast in our cottage, got ourselves packed up and headed off (after a quick trip to the Indian restaurant where we&amp;#8217;d eaten the night before to pick up the rucksack we&amp;#8217;d left there by accident!</description>
