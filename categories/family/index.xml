      <description>I suppose it shouldn&amp;#8217;t come as a surprise that a reporter would have a blog. Nor that &amp;#8220;Santa Al&amp;#8221; would make a blog-worthy impression. Still, it&amp;#8217;s a bit of a trip to run across. OK, I didn&amp;#8217;t really &amp;#8220;run across&amp;#8221; it &amp;#8212; he forwarded it to me. But there you go. A reporter got caught up in my dad&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;alternate reality&amp;#8221; field. Maybe that&amp;#8217;s why I&amp;#8217;ve been into virtual worlds for so long; I&amp;#8217;m just trying to recreate my childhood.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Well, Chrissum time is over. Alas, by the end you were saying &amp;#8220;Christmas&amp;#8221; about as often as you said Crissum. Your little approximations of words are cute and fleeting. Already I miss getting to hear the babble of your baby talk and wish I&amp;#8217;d found a way to record more of it. This month has begun a real inquisitive phase for you. You have a hard time being adjacent to a conversation without saying something like &amp;#8220;What&amp;#8217;s mommy and daddy talking about?</description>

      <description>I guess this really has been a bay area weekend. Yesterday, we went down to Berkeley partly just to wander, partly to pick up a kid-sized table and chairs for Sam that Carolyn arranged to buy through BPN but partly to go to Half Price Books. We were seeking the third book in the Song of Fire and Ice series &amp;#8212; A Storm of Swords. I gave up on the series after the first book &amp;#8212; too much soap opera, too little fantasy, but it engulfed Carolyn like a raging storm (of swords?</description>

      <description>The past 3 weekends have all been wet in some way or another. I went sailing on the bay on a 30&amp;#8242; Hunter a few weeks ago. Last weekend, we went to a beach that&amp;#8217;s a 10-or-so minute drive pretty much due west of our house, and this weekend we went to the 36th annual NCMA boat show. It was great except that we got a late start so that we didn&amp;#8217;t get much time there before we had to come back for nap time.</description>

      <description>I have been remiss in my updates here. It&amp;#8217;s been a busy time at work, and to a certain extent at home. The work&amp;#8217;s not done, maybe I can talk about it once it has been. But there have been some big events of late. My mom&amp;#8217;s husband, Tom, died (see below.) After his death, and I hope for some recovery, she came out to visit spending about two weeks with us.</description>
