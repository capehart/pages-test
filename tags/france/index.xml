      <description>We took the Eurostar from London to Paris on Thursday, and returned today (Sunday). I took Thursday off, and then worked from &amp;#8220;Home&amp;#8221; on Friday. We have about a 15 (adult) minute walk from the flat to the Brighton train station. From there, it&amp;#8217;s a little under an hour to London, St. Pancras. From there, a little under three hours to Paris Gare de Nord. From there, 15 min on the Paris Metro and 5 minutes to the flat.</description>
