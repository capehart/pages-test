      <description>We&amp;#8217;re doing some cleaning up getting ready to go to England and I see a crumpled (from travel) piece of paper on my desk&amp;#8230; It&amp;#8217;s the tasting chart from scotchbuddy.com as I was part of this tasting group.
Rather than continue to live with a crumpled piece of paper on my desk, I&amp;#8217;m going to preserve the results in my blog where you can refer to it in case you ever wish to buy me scotch.</description>
