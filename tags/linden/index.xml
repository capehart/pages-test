      <description>No, not diabolical lesbians, but instead a valley (and surrounding hillside) that&amp;#8217;s part of the South Downs in Sussex, not far north of Brighton and Hove. Now maintained by the National Trust. Carolyn, Sam and I had an outing there after a late Sunday breakfast. We hiked around, had a picnic lunch, and I got some kite flying in. I was worried that I was going to have packed my kite for nothing, but already I&amp;#8217;ve flown both days this weekend.</description>
