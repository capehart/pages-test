              <p>Dear Sammy,</p>

<p>For your newsletter describing your 30th month of life, Iâ€™ve been collecting phrases that weâ€™ve heard around the house. These are the ones that make your Dad and me grin, or gasp, or sometimes grimace. But in each case, we look at each other and mouth â€œdid she just say that?â€</p>

<p>Here you go. Soundbites from a 2Â½ year-old girl:</p>

<p>â€œMommies donâ€™t go to work. Daddies do.â€</p>

<p>â€œIâ€™m not a big girl yet. Iâ€™m a little girl.â€</p>

<p>â€œMommy, I missed you when you went to your haircut. Daddy, I missed you when you were <a href="http://www.choicywhiteboy.com/2008/03/see-whom">seeing Attle.</a>â€</p>

<p>â€œShall we have a toast?â€</p>

<p>â€œWhatâ€™s that all about?â€</p>

<p>â€œMommy, Iâ€™m so proud of you.â€</p>

<p>â€œI have an idea.â€</p>

<p>â€œIâ€™m cracking you up!â€</p>

<p>â€œI donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m talking about!â€</p>

<p>â€œWhy am I talking about that?â€</p>

<p>Some of these turns of phrase fascinate us because they show us where you are in your understanding of the world. Some of them indeed do â€œcrack us upâ€ because they demonstrate the ways in which you have and have not assimilated our language. But the very last one deserves a special mention. For, as you crested into age 2 Â½, you have begun to pursue a new line of questioning. We have embraced this new phase with equal parts pride and exasperation. Whyâ€¦? Because you are now asking â€œwhyâ€ questions.</p>

<p>At first, we were excited. It was enormously satisfying to answer your questions, and to see you frame your curiosity about the world in new ways. â€œWhy do we take baths?â€ â€œWhy did you put socks on me?â€ â€œWhy do we garden?â€ â€œMommy, why did you honk the horn at that car?â€ Well, perhaps it was more embarrassing than satisfying to answer that last one. The other day you asked Daddy â€œWhy is it windy?â€ â€œBecause certain parts of the earth heat up faster than other parts,â€ he replied. That was cool. You expressed curiosity about wind, asked about it, and received an interesting answer. (Plus, your mother learned something that she didnâ€™t know. Please continue to address questions about meteorology and all things mechanical to your father.)</p>

<p>So why are we exasperated half the time? Because your â€œwhyâ€ doesnâ€™t really mean â€œwhy,â€ at least in the way that most adults understand it. For you, â€œwhyâ€ is more like a conversation opener. â€œTalk to me about wind,â€ you might have said to your father. â€œMommy, letâ€™s process what happened just now when that other car cut you off and you honked the car horn and yelled.â€ But those are weighty sentences for you. And you often hear people ask â€œwhy?â€ and so it must make perfect sense to you that asking â€œwhy?â€ would be a good way to get some more information.</p>

<p>But the problem is that Dad and I usually take your â€œwhysâ€ at face value. And then something like this happens:</p>

<p>Sam: â€œWhere are we going?â€</p>

<p>Mom: â€œWeâ€™re going home.â€</p>

<p>Sam: â€œWhy are we going home?â€</p>

<p>Mom: â€œBecause itâ€™s getting close to nap time.â€</p>

<p>Sam: â€œWhy is it getting close to nap time?â€</p>

<p>Mom: â€œBecause nap time is in the afternoon, and it is now afternoon.â€</p>

<p>Sam: â€œWhy is it afternoon?â€</p>

<p>Mom: â€œBecause morning is over.â€</p>

<p>Sam: â€œWhy is morning over?â€</p>

<p>Mom: â€œBecause it ended, itâ€™s all done. And now itâ€™s afternoon.â€</p>

<p>You can probably guess your next questionâ€¦ and so there we are, walking home, stuck in the infinite â€œwhyâ€ loop of a two-year old. I usually get us out by distracting you with another line of questioning: â€œLook at that bird flying!â€ You: â€œWhy is that bird flying?â€ Or, Iâ€™ll pull out the one conversation stopper left to me, the one I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d use so soon: â€œBecause I said so.â€</p>

<p>Turns out thatâ€™s an effective way to abruptly change the topic in your newsletter too!</p>

<p>There was a lot more to your 30th month than questions and loops. You had a lot of little â€œfirstsâ€ this March: you and Daddy flew a kite, you got to plant flowers and seeds with me out in our backyard, you learned how to throw a giant Frisbee, you colored hardboiled eggs, and you had your first Easter egg hunt. The first of many this month, as you adore both hunting and hiding for eggs, and why should such a fun activity be limited to one day a year only? Oops, thereâ€™s that pesky â€œwhyâ€ again. Guess you come by it honestly ;-). I must say that I got a kick out of our daily egg hunts. For a couple of weeks, every afternoon, you and I would take turns hiding eggs for each other in the backyard. â€œStay inside, Mommy, no peeking!â€ It was a hoot to see where you would hide them, although you usually deprived me of the pleasure of the hunt itself, because as soon as I would come back outside, you would lead me around and show me yourself where you had hidden the eggs. Or youâ€™d say â€œLet me give you a hint, Mommyâ€ and then show me.</p>

<p>That was a fun game. And more and more you do indeed play games with us, meaning, you can follow simple rules, take turns, and follow whatâ€™s going on. You still donâ€™t really care about the outcome of a game, about winning or losing. You are all about the process. And thatâ€™s refreshing. We played â€œsoccerâ€ and â€œkickballâ€ with Daddy on Easter. You learned to play a game called â€œCement Showersâ€ from your new friends Dylan and Erin. And you LOVE to play â€œRed Light Green Light,â€ which Dad and I taught you. Last time you and I played together, you introduced â€œBlue Lightâ€ into the mix, which means, apparently, that the people trying to get to the traffic light are to walk in a crouch and giggle.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s been new indoor play this month too. Mom-mom gave you a tea and dinner party set for St. Patrickâ€™s Day, and so you and various bears have enjoyed tea and wine parties together (who says you canâ€™t enjoy both together?). When my laptop died last month, you and I spent considerable time at the Apple Store, where they have computer stations set up for kids. And thatâ€™s where you played your first computer game soloâ€”a Sesame Street coloring activity. (I figure your Dad wants that â€œfirstâ€ recorded). At home, weâ€™ve been letting you play with an online alphabet game for a few minutes each morning. You love it, and itâ€™s helping reinforce your letter and phonemic awareness. Weâ€™ll be driving somewhere, and instead of questioning my driving practices, youâ€™ll shout out, â€œMommy I see a T! And thereâ€™s an A! And another T!â€ Your first spelled word is indeed likely to be Target.</p>

<p>Or maybe Trader Joeâ€™s. We spend time there every week. I am very proud of you for asking the cashiers for stickers&#8211;all by yourself! There was a time when you would hide your face in my shoulder every time a cashier tried to talk to you. Now you will look him or her in the eye, andâ€¦ start belting out tunes. â€œTwinkle twinkleâ€ is the usual number. I really donâ€™t know what it is about store cashiers that make you want to sing. Perhaps itâ€™s just a calming device for you, or an easy way to verbally engage a stranger. The cashiers usually smile, or gape. It definitely shuts them up, though. Aha, maybe THATâ€™s your strategy. Way to go, baby girl.</p>

<p>Of course, you sing all the time at home too. But there you have no qualms about asking me to stop talking, or singing. â€œNo, Mommy, donâ€™t sing. We sing in the car.â€ In the house weâ€™ve been listening to a CD of French childrenâ€™s music. It is your hands-down favorite, and you request it every day, several times a day. Your favorites are â€œAlouetteâ€ and â€œA la ferme de Zephirin,â€ which is a French version of â€œOld MacDonald.â€ You are learning the words to all the songs (as am I) by listening to them, although you have no idea what you are singing, and youâ€™ll ask me what the song is about. I do get such a lift out of hearing your little voice croon â€œSur le pont dâ€™Avignonâ€ and I canâ€™t wait to show you the bridge itself one day.</p>

<p>While there were no such trips for you and me, travel did play a big role in our lives this past month. Daddy went to <a href="http://www.choicywhiteboy.com/2008/03/see-whom">â€œsee Attleâ€</a> for a whole week, and my friend Robin from Altoona came to visit. You adored Robin, who entertained you by making your bears sing musical numbers about their names. We also got to spend a little time with â€œUnkie Johnâ€ who was in town on business. Weâ€™ll be seeing a lot more of him quite soon, as heâ€™s moving to our part of the world to start a new job!</p>

<p>Yes, spring is for beginnings. Two years ago we were just entertaining the notion of moving to California. And now my brother and sister-in-law are going through the same process. Weird, huh? Loops. Cycles. I donâ€™t know why life moves cyclically, Sammy, but I do promise you that weâ€™ll talk about it. Maybe not today, thoughâ€¦ how about in a yearâ€¦ or two? Happy 2 Â½ years, baby girl. We are so proud of you.</p>

<p>Love,</p>

<p>Mommy</p>

<p>P.S. Do feel free to ask Daddy why itâ€™s not foggy today. Iâ€™m curious to hear the answer.</p>

Even though I&rsquo;ve taken some good precautions on the host, I&rsquo;ve failed to keep wordpress up-to-date. This has allowed script-kiddies and others with more time than quality of life to repurpose it. No longer!
With Hugo, I do site generation localy and upload static HTML. What does this mean for you? Faster page loads, and content that I actually produced.</div>

We weren&#8217;t really sure what we wanted to do today, but we had talked about doing one of the &#8220;bus to bus&#8221; walks in Brighton where you could take a bus to one of the stops and then do a country walk in the Sussex downs to somewhere else that a bus runs, and catch that back into town. As a family, we&#8217;d done the Ditchling Beacon to Devil&#8217;s Dyke walk once.</div>

I wish I were more observant about the mundane, because in some important ways, I think it&#8217;s the mudane that matters far more than the extrordinary. At least in story telling.
We left Philadelphia Thursday evening. We flew from the international terminal at PHL on USAirways. We were originally supposed to fly from A6 at one end of the terminal, and shortly after we settled down there, an announcement came over the PA that there was a gate change and we needed to switch to A23 at the other end of the terminal.</div>

I came across this posting on the python group I&#8217;m a member of on (in?) Linked In.
The first typo, was a bit awkward, but I could see how it would happen during an editing/revision session when that session wasn&#8217;t followed by a proofreading. &#8220;Our client is a leader in the worldwide leader&#8221;. So, what you&#8217;re saying is they lead?
But what actually cracked me up was the simple substitution of a &#8220;t&#8221; where a &#8220;d&#8221; should go.</div>

I&#8217;m listening to my &#8220;Everything but the Girl&#8221; radio station on Pandora. As Carolyn put it, &#8220;Is it nothing but Everything But the Girl&#8221;? Pleasant enough in itself, but thanks to Lexus, I&#8217;m enjoying it as part of a free trial to Pandora One. It&#8217;s funny how it&#8217;s the little things.
