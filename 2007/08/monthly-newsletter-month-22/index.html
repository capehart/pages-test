              <p>Dear Sammy,</p>

<p>Daddy was going to write your letter this month, but since a) heâ€™s sick, and b) heâ€™s working for <a href="http://www.siggraph.org/s2007/">SIGGRAPH</a> at San Diego this week, and c) youâ€™re giving me a nice long nap this afternoon, I decided that I would start it.</p>

<p>So, hi Sammy! Happy 22 months old! Youâ€™re two months away from two years old. Technically. In practical terms, youâ€™re right smack dab in the middle of the Terrible Twoâ€™s. All my life Iâ€™ve heard of this phase, but it is only in the past month that I have come to understand just what it can mean. Hereâ€™s what it means for you:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Everything belongs to you: youâ€™ll see a little kid clutching a grubby teddy bear, or a sippy cup, and youâ€™ll point at it and say â€œSammyâ€™s!â€ Same thing for strollers, cars, airplanes, books. Itâ€™s all yours.</p></li>

<li><p>Itâ€™s always your turn, except when itâ€™s time to wash hands before dinner. When we go to Tassajara playground and you see kids on the see-saw, you shout, â€œSammyâ€™s turn!â€ But when itâ€™s mealtime, you declare, â€œMommy wash hands first.â€</p></li>

<li><p>You must do everything yourself, even those things that you canâ€™t quite manage on your own. â€œSammy do that!â€ is the refrain here. You now climb in and out of your high chair and car seat by yourself, and if Dad or I forget and absentmindedly hoist you up into the seat, you scold us pretty vociferously. Whatâ€™s difficult is that there are many things that you canâ€™t do on your own, but you throw a fit if we try to help. Putting your shoes on, hanging your jacket up on its peg, putting a barrette in your hair. One day you fussed at me for a good 20 minutes because you wouldnâ€™t let me take your jacket off, and yet you couldnâ€™t get your arms out of the tight sleeves by yourself.</p></li>

<li><p>You want it, and you want it NOW: this can apply to just about anything. Heaven forbid I tell you that weâ€™re going to the library or the zoo tomorrow, or in an hour. I have just committed one of the worst offenses in the toddler universe of â€œall is present.â€ I will pay for that transgression.</p></li>

<li><p>You do not want to do whatever it is weâ€™re doing: â€œWeâ€™re walking to Meriâ€™s house,â€ I say. â€œNO! I wanna go home!â€ you say all the way down to Meriâ€™s house. Then of course, when we leave Meriâ€™s house, you stop on the sidewalk and turn back â€œI go Meriâ€™s house.â€</p></li>

<li><p>You must do everything yourself (did I already mention this one?) even those things that you have asked us to do. â€œMommy draw kitty cat?â€ youâ€™ll ask me. Iâ€™ll sit down and start to draw you a cat, and youâ€™ll immediately yank the crayon out of my hand, and say, â€œSammy do that!â€ Ditto with certain books. â€œMommy read it?â€ No sooner have I uttered one word than you shake your head in disgust, â€œNo, no, Sammy read it.â€</p></li>
</ol>

<p>While the uncooperative behavior is sometimes tiring for us lumbering adults, we do of course recognize that it means youâ€™re growing up, youâ€™re forming your own ideas, and expressing your own opinions. Pajamas are a great outfit for the afternoon. Short sleeves should be extendable to your wrists. Red socks go with everything. Bell peppers cry when you slice them for salad. Camus always deserves a treat and a big bowl of cat food.</p>

<p>These last two refer to your favorite helping activities of late: you love to give Camus a cat treat (though you are nervous to let him eat out of your hand) and you love to pour his dry food into his bowl. Sometimes you dump it by accident onto the floor, but if I ask you to pick it up, youâ€™ll pick up each individual crunchie and place it carefully in his bowl. At least you clean up after your messes now. One day I found you with an enormous wad of baby wipes â€œcleaningâ€ the legs of your high chair. I was about to scold you for taking the wipes, and then thought â€œwell, at least she is using them to clean something up.â€</p>

<p>The other helping activity is cooking. Well, preparing food to cook. We pull the kitchen step ladder up to the countertop (â€œSammy use it?â€ you always ask). Then you watch me chop vegetables for the salad and you sort the scraps into the compost bin and put the veggies into the salad bowl. Usually. Sometimes you eat most of the vegetables that I prepare. You will try just about anything this way tooâ€”youâ€™ve tasted raw zucchini, scallions, and even raw sweet potato. Sometimes Iâ€™ll show you how to stir liquids (we were making soup, and you kept calling it a â€œbathâ€™) but you donâ€™t quite have the arm action down yet for stirring. Still, I must admit that I love sharing this activity with you, and hope that weâ€™ll have many years of cooking together ahead of us.</p>

<p>So about now youâ€™re thinking, â€œCooking, cleaning, feeding the catâ€¦ hey, Mom, did we do anything fun?â€ Yes we did. We rode the <a href="http://www.ncry.org/">Niles Canyon historic railroad</a> with Meri, Dante, and their parents. You played in your kiddie pool out back on warm afternoons. We went to the library at Cal Berkeley a couple of times, and you threw leaves into the creek that runs through the campus. We went on a toddler-sized hike around <a href="http://sanfrancisco.about.com/od/kidfriendly/ss/jewellaketrail.htm">Jewel lake</a> with your new neighborhood pals Olivia (4) and Rosie (2). But do you know what your very favorite activity is? The thing that you ask to do each and every day? You like to show your father <a href="http://www.monsterfool.com/?p=85">where Australia is on the world map in your room</a>. â€œShow Daddy where Australia is?â€ Yep, youâ€™re a geography head.</p>

<p>Now, to be truthful, in your mind, showing Dad where Australia is on the map also includes a game where you and he toss your crib plushies around the room. But you always start with geography. There is no doubt in our minds that you are our daughter. Your father and I love maps. Youâ€™ve impressed us not only with your ability to locate various countries on the map, but also with your pronunciation. â€œUnited Statesâ€ is probably the most difficult. Plus, you often point right to the printed word on the map. You can locate Australia, China, Russia, Egypt, France, Spain, the U.S., Mexico, Canada, and Japan. Daddy is also teaching you various countries in central Africa. When he showed you Mali, you pointed to the brown teddy bear in your crib and asked â€œMolly?â€ It&#8217;s now your favorite central African state!</p>

<p>Molly, Emma Bear, and the entire host of stuffed animals and dolls that have taken up residence in our house have become very real to you. You read books to them, put them to sleep and wake them up. Emma bear even â€œsingsâ€ the ABC song (with your help). The rest of the crib plushies sing the ABC&#8217;s with Dad&#8217;s help at your frequent insistence. The other week you brought your baby doll Ginny into the kitchen, pulled one of your old bottles out of your kitchen drawer, fed it to Ginny, burped her, gave her a bath in a different drawer, then closed the drawer and shouted â€œgo to sleep!â€ That was an interesting interpretation of our bedtime ritual with you. (Daddy and I donâ€™t shout, but there are some nights where we might secretly think â€œGo to sleep!â€)</p>

<p>You still drink milk before bath time at night, but itâ€™s now from a cup. We finally weaned you from bottles this past month, and it was surprisingly not difficult. I was worried that you would resist since you are not a thumb sucker, and you havenâ€™t used a pacifier in over a year. (Sucking is supposed to be one of those self-soothing reflexes that lasts well beyond the first year.) So the bottles have gone into your kitchen drawer, as you take another step away from babyhood.</p>

<p>Steps, skips, and one-footed hops, too. I worry significantly less now when I see you walking up and down stairs. You can walk up without holding on to anything now, though you still reach for a hand or a rail on the way down. Youâ€™re much more nimble on your feet in general. You can almost imitate me skipping, though you canâ€™t manage a two-footed jump yet. Youâ€™re becoming an agile climber, and were very proud of yourself recently when you climbed up the slide at the playground by yourself, after seeing some big kids do it.</p>

<p>Your biggest leaps, however, continue to be in the realm of language. You speak in complete sentences about half the time now. You use prepositions. You still refer to yourself mostly in the third person, but use the first person from time to time too. You know almost all of the alphabet, not only the letters and their order, but also what they â€œsay.â€ The letters that give you the most trouble currently are â€œJ,â€ â€œL,â€ and â€œN.â€ You love to point out letters everywhere. I was wearing a Swarthmore College t-shirt the other day and you spelled out â€œSwarthmoreâ€ almost perfectlyâ€”it was those darn lowercase letters that confused you. Youâ€™ll often point to a lowercase â€œpâ€ and call it a â€œB.â€</p>

<p>Youâ€™ll also scribble lines on paper and tell us that they are letters, or circles, or squares, or kitty cats. Drawing or â€œcoloringâ€ is one of your favorite daily activities. With that in mind, here are some other favorites this month:</p>

<p>Favorite song to sing: â€œTapent les petites mains.â€ Yes you really sing it now! (Well, you emphasize the key words and kind of hum the parts you arenâ€™t sure of, not all that different from how I sing along with the radio.) You also love the refrain of â€œYou are my Sunshineâ€ when you shout â€œsunshine away!â€</p>

<p>Favorite numbers: the answer to â€œhow manyâ€ is almost always â€œone two three four fiveâ€ though occasionally youâ€™ll go up to 10.</p>

<p>Favorite book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Baby-Beebee-Diane-Redfield-Massie/dp/0060280832/ref=ed_oe_h/102-9317900-6591351">The Baby Beebee Bird</a> by Diane Redfield Massie and Steven Kellogg, your first borrowed library book.</p>

<p>Favorite joke: â€œRed light go?â€ asked while weâ€™re driving somewhere. The correct response to your query is â€œNo, no, no, red light means stop!â€ Giggling, youâ€™ll ask â€œred light go?â€ 12 times or more then suddenly switch to â€œgreen light go?â€ just to see if weâ€™re paying attention.</p>

<p>I was never so happy about your attention to traffic lights as I was on the <a href="http://www.monsterfool.com/?p=79">4th of July</a>. Independence Day saw us racing to the ER after you woke up lethargic with rapid breathing. After a dose of Albuterol through an inhaler (which you hated), you perked up enough to tell us the colors of the traffic lights as we drove home. It turns out that you might have asthma. It will become a firm diagnosis if such breathing problems recur regularly. As health problems go, asthmaâ€”treated properlyâ€”should not be a big deal. Still and all, Daddy and I hope that it was just a nasty virus that you picked up from your recent travels from Philadelphia.</p>

<p>You are indeed a well-traveled little girl, Sammy, as I close this letter from a hotel room in San Diego. (The telling of that adventure will have to wait until next month). And you are also well-loved, well-cherished, well-kissed, and well-hugged, even and especially when the terrible two monster erupts screaming, â€œI wanna go home, NOW!â€</p>

<p>Love,</p>

<p>Mommy</p>

Even though I&rsquo;ve taken some good precautions on the host, I&rsquo;ve failed to keep wordpress up-to-date. This has allowed script-kiddies and others with more time than quality of life to repurpose it. No longer!
With Hugo, I do site generation localy and upload static HTML. What does this mean for you? Faster page loads, and content that I actually produced.</div>

We weren&#8217;t really sure what we wanted to do today, but we had talked about doing one of the &#8220;bus to bus&#8221; walks in Brighton where you could take a bus to one of the stops and then do a country walk in the Sussex downs to somewhere else that a bus runs, and catch that back into town. As a family, we&#8217;d done the Ditchling Beacon to Devil&#8217;s Dyke walk once.</div>

I wish I were more observant about the mundane, because in some important ways, I think it&#8217;s the mudane that matters far more than the extrordinary. At least in story telling.
We left Philadelphia Thursday evening. We flew from the international terminal at PHL on USAirways. We were originally supposed to fly from A6 at one end of the terminal, and shortly after we settled down there, an announcement came over the PA that there was a gate change and we needed to switch to A23 at the other end of the terminal.</div>

I came across this posting on the python group I&#8217;m a member of on (in?) Linked In.
The first typo, was a bit awkward, but I could see how it would happen during an editing/revision session when that session wasn&#8217;t followed by a proofreading. &#8220;Our client is a leader in the worldwide leader&#8221;. So, what you&#8217;re saying is they lead?
But what actually cracked me up was the simple substitution of a &#8220;t&#8221; where a &#8220;d&#8221; should go.</div>

I was invited to a &#8220;buy nothing&#8221; day on Facebook. I suppose if the point is to raise awareness of needless consumerism, I&#8217;m a fan. But in this era of anti-capitalism, of the &#8220;99%&#8221;, I&#8217;m wary.</div>

I&#8217;m listening to my &#8220;Everything but the Girl&#8221; radio station on Pandora. As Carolyn put it, &#8220;Is it nothing but Everything But the Girl&#8221;? Pleasant enough in itself, but thanks to Lexus, I&#8217;m enjoying it as part of a free trial to Pandora One. It&#8217;s funny how it&#8217;s the little things.
