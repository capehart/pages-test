              <p>Dear Sam,</p>

<p>When I put you down for your afternoon nap just now, you sang along to your bedtime song â€œSamantha, fais dodo.â€ I was trying not to smile too hard, because, you knowâ€¦ itâ€™s nap time and you have a hard enough time as it is settling down to rest. When we finished the song, you exclaimed â€œSammy did it!â€ After I left the room, you reprised the song, and then added a few rounds of â€œFrÃ¨re Jacques,â€ followed by a rousing rendition of â€œPop Goes the Weasel.â€ When you wake up, youâ€™ll pick up right where you left off. This is the soundtrack of our lives, and of your 25th month: your sweet little voice belting out nursery rhymes.</p>

<p>You love to sing, Sammy. You sing all the timeâ€”while falling asleep, upon waking up, while playing, while reading, while eating. Youâ€™ve even started to mix up the verbs â€œsingâ€ and â€œread,â€ often handing me a book and asking, â€œMommy, sing it?â€ I was tempted to write â€œYou love music,â€ but thatâ€™s not quite true anymore, as will you often demand that I turn off the stereo. You also tell me to stop singing too, which irritates me, as one of my little pleasures is singing along to the radio while driving. No, you want to be the sole maker of music and song in our house these days. Daddy and I gave you a bunch of wooden instruments for your birthday, so we have no one to blame but ourselves. Youâ€™ve taken to the harmonica and the recorder, which you often play upside down. You also like to sing â€œMary had a little lambâ€ while drumming on the xylophone. This afternoon, while we were driving back from the Berkeley Aquatic Park, you sang a little song of your own deviseâ€”â€œMommy loves rabbit.â€ (You had one of your plushie bunnies in the car seat with you). I donâ€™t actually love that rabbit, but I do love that you are flexing your creativity.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s evident in all of your play. Your imaginative world is growing. You often play by yourself now, talking to your animals and toys, making them interact with one another. Your new figurines â€œBen and Samanthaâ€ were â€œparking carsâ€ on top of the kitchen trash can yesterday. You recently gave Emma Bear a diaper change using an old file folder. You love â€œfeedingâ€ your baby dolls, and for a while every morning you played at â€œgoing to workâ€ like Daddy. Little sponge that you are, you have picked up on one of my morning rituals that is surely both helpful and irritating to your father: before he heads out the door, I ask him if he has everything he needs for the day. So now you chime in too, asking Daddy, â€œHave your laptop? Have your phone? Have your iPod? Have your lunch? Something to read?â€ After Dad has left, you then demand a zippered bag in which to pack your own â€œlaptopâ€ (doodle pad), â€œphoneâ€ (my old cell phone) and â€œiPodâ€ (an old plastic keychain). You throw in a few board books and youâ€™re good to go!</p>

<p>Conversations are more imaginative too. I forget how this got started, but one of your favorite things is to â€œtalk about bears.â€ What this means is that your interlocutor must ask you questions about bears, and you supply the answers. Example:</p>

<p>Sam: Talk about bears?</p>

<p>Mom: Ok. What do bears like to eat?</p>

<p>Sam: Nachos! And corn! And pepper ownee!</p>

<p>Mom: Wow.</p>

<p>Sam: Talk about bears again?</p>

<p>Mom: Where do bears like to go?</p>

<p>Sam: Bears go over the mountain.</p>

<p>Mom: Oh. What do they do over the mountain?</p>

<p>Sam: Bears take a big bath. With Mommy!</p>

<p>Mom: Ohh.</p>

<p>Sam: Talk about bears again?</p>

<p>And so on. It is really fascinating to watch you integrate your own experiences into another story. Itâ€™s even more exciting to see you make connections from the stories we read back to your own life. In â€œFancy Nancy,â€ the title character puts on a bathrobe, and you say â€œJust like Mommy!â€ We were leaving a playground to go pick up Dad from the BART station and I said â€œhurry!â€ and you said â€œJust like â€œThomas and the Big Big Bridge!â€ One of the train cars in the tale tells Thomas to hurry. This happens all the time and I am often astounded at the details you remember. We were listening to a recording of Beatrix Potterâ€™s â€œMiss Moppetâ€ and Potter uses the word â€œill.â€ The first time you heard it, you said â€œJust like the Pie and the Patty-pan!â€ Thatâ€™s another Potter story, and sure enough, the term â€œillâ€ is used there too.</p>

<p>Now that Iâ€™m writing all this down, I see that the thread here is memory. You have a terrific memoryâ€”one that allows you to sing songs and recite books. One that allows you to make connections between stories and life. One that allows you to learn the names and shapes of all the vehicles in the vintage 70â€™s Simplex puzzle you received from Grand-mÃ¨re for your birthday. The puzzle had been your Dadâ€™s, but even he didnâ€™t remember what a â€œCooperâ€ or a â€œDafâ€ looked like. Someday youâ€™ll astound someone with your knowledge of antique cars.</p>

<p>Of course, the accompaniment to these cognitive advances is emotional developmentâ€”and for you lately that means development of fear. Youâ€™ve always been cautious, especially around new people. But in the last month or so you have become especially fearful around other kids, even the playmates youâ€™ve known for months and see regularly. This could be another consequence of a good memory. Your pediatrician suggested that perhaps once another toddler got up in your face and scared you. I can think of a couple of tricky encounters like that. But still, you do become quite anxious when we go to playgroups or to the playground. A few weeks ago we were walking up the hill to Tassajara and you stopped in your tracks and said, â€œNo kids at the playground. Just Mommy and Sammy.â€ I had to explain to you that I had no control over the presence or absence of others at the playground, and that we could just check it out and if you didnâ€™t want to stay, we could leave. That calmed you and when we got to the playground you decided to stay, but you wanted to hold my hand the whole time.</p>

<p>Playgroup is similar. Lately you sit on my lap the whole time and just watch the other kids play, though you do interact with them in small ways. You like to â€œplay ballâ€ with Dante (from the safety of my lap) and I remember you playing with one of Meriâ€™s toy animals and shouting at her across the room, â€œMeri, I have a little sheep!â€ Usually when itâ€™s time to go you come out of your shell. One time as we were getting ready to leave, you got on Meriâ€™s rocking horse and bounced gleefully, until one of the kids came running into the room near you. I could see the conflict play out on your face in the space of one breath: keep playing on the horse or run back to Mom? You chose safety. We do hope that in the coming months, youâ€™ll learn that your playmates are safe too, and that youâ€™ll choose to play with them.</p>

<p>Your flight response to kids is almost like an allergic reaction. Maybe it is. You tested positive this month for peanut allergy, which means that your body treats peanuts as a dangerous substance. Fortunately, you tested negative for all other nuts and for shellfish. So while you canâ€™t eat any of the Reeseâ€™s peanut butter cups I thoughtlessly bought for Halloween this year, one day youâ€™ll be able to enjoy macadamia-nut-encrusted shrimp.</p>

<p>You DID enjoy your first taste of candy this month. A few licks of cherry and grape tootsie pops, spoils from your first trick-or-treat. You had a grand Halloween, although you refused to walk for most of the trick-or-treating. Those pesky kids again.</p>

<p>Oh, Sammy, one month, one little girl, and so much to tell! We visited two pumpkin patches, met up with â€œBaby Katrinaâ€ a couple of times, and hosted your cousin Scott and his fiancÃ©e Sigal for a night. Scott and Sigal gave you a white teddy bear which we named â€œLylaâ€ (Hebrew for â€œNightâ€â€”Sigal is from Israel). Lyla is now the favored bear.</p>

<p>Oh and you just woke up! I need to wrap this up fast. Let me conclude with some things weâ€™ve overheard you sayâ€¦ the kind of utterances that makes Dad and me grin foolishly at each other and say simultaneously, â€œSheâ€™s so cute!â€</p>

<p>â€œOh, I love you Camus.â€</p>

<p>â€œHow ya doin, Mommy?â€</p>

<p>â€œDude!â€ (said in repetition of your mother)</p>

<p>â€œIt tastes like poop!â€</p>

<p>This last one has an explanation. At weekly storytime at the library, a little puppet mouse named Miss Sophie likes to â€œtasteâ€ the kidsâ€™ fingers and say what they taste like. You love this and play the game at home, usually with your yellow bath ducks. One evening in the bath, a duck tasted my finger and you exclaimed the above along with peels of laughter. Your first scatological joke. As with all your milestones, Dad and I couldnâ€™t be prouder. (Though we do hope that youâ€™ll soon choose â€œcleanerâ€ material for your joke routine.) Youâ€™re so cute.</p>

<p>Love,</p>

<p>Mommy</p>

Even though I&rsquo;ve taken some good precautions on the host, I&rsquo;ve failed to keep wordpress up-to-date. This has allowed script-kiddies and others with more time than quality of life to repurpose it. No longer!
With Hugo, I do site generation localy and upload static HTML. What does this mean for you? Faster page loads, and content that I actually produced.</div>

We weren&#8217;t really sure what we wanted to do today, but we had talked about doing one of the &#8220;bus to bus&#8221; walks in Brighton where you could take a bus to one of the stops and then do a country walk in the Sussex downs to somewhere else that a bus runs, and catch that back into town. As a family, we&#8217;d done the Ditchling Beacon to Devil&#8217;s Dyke walk once.</div>

I wish I were more observant about the mundane, because in some important ways, I think it&#8217;s the mudane that matters far more than the extrordinary. At least in story telling.
We left Philadelphia Thursday evening. We flew from the international terminal at PHL on USAirways. We were originally supposed to fly from A6 at one end of the terminal, and shortly after we settled down there, an announcement came over the PA that there was a gate change and we needed to switch to A23 at the other end of the terminal.</div>

I came across this posting on the python group I&#8217;m a member of on (in?) Linked In.
The first typo, was a bit awkward, but I could see how it would happen during an editing/revision session when that session wasn&#8217;t followed by a proofreading. &#8220;Our client is a leader in the worldwide leader&#8221;. So, what you&#8217;re saying is they lead?
But what actually cracked me up was the simple substitution of a &#8220;t&#8221; where a &#8220;d&#8221; should go.</div>

I&#8217;m listening to my &#8220;Everything but the Girl&#8221; radio station on Pandora. As Carolyn put it, &#8220;Is it nothing but Everything But the Girl&#8221;? Pleasant enough in itself, but thanks to Lexus, I&#8217;m enjoying it as part of a free trial to Pandora One. It&#8217;s funny how it&#8217;s the little things.
