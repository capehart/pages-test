              <p>If I get paid for some recent work, I think I&#8217;ll have enough dough for a new computer. This is good because while I have a fleet of computers, they&#8217;re all old and getting older. My newest one is about 3 years old &#8212; about the usable lifespan of a computer. I&#8217;m trying to decide what computer to get next and am soliciting your input.</p>

<p>So far in my life, I&#8217;ve never purchased a laptop for myself. The two that I have came from 1) an old job and 2) my mom who pretty much just stopped using the one she bought for herself a couple of years ago. In buying hardware for myself, I always wanted the greater computing power for the buck that a desktop provides. Currently, thanks to my wireless setup and a general need to be where the action is in the house, I&#8217;ve found myself using my laptop(s) much more, whether computing on the back porch or in my new make-shift office (AKA table) in the living room. That said, once set up in one of those locations, I don&#8217;t tend to move it around much, so I&#8217;m still not sure how essential laptopage is. So, that&#8217;s the first decision that needs to be made: Laptop vs. Desktop.</p>

<p>The next decision is Mac vs. Wintel. I have a soft spot for Macs &#8212; the first computer I ever bought was a Macintosh SE, and I was the Apple Student Rep in college. But I&#8217;ve not owned a Mac since they made the transition from the MC6800 chip set to the PowerPC. Regardless of this decision, I will at least be dual-booting into Ubuntu (or some other distro, but I&#8217;ve been liking Ubuntu of late). I have one resource for finding out about personal experiences of Ubuntu on Mac, but I think he has a much higher tolerance than I do for trying to make half-baked packages work. (Hi, Victor) If anyone else who reads me has an opinion of Ubuntu (or other distro) on PPC, I&#8217;d like to hear it.</p>

<p>Another factor is that I&#8217;m a gamer. Fortunately, I&#8217;m not a bleeding- (or even leading-) edge gamer. I don&#8217;t have to have to be able to play the latest high-poly-count FPS (First-Person Shooter) at 60 FPS (Frames Per Second). But I was unable to even install <a href="http://www.eagames.com/official/lordoftherings/thebattleformiddleearth/us/home.jsp">EA&#8217;s LotR: Battle for Middle Earth</a> on my current Windows PC, so I am going to need to catch up on that front before too long.</p>

<p>So, I&#8217;m looking for a certain amount of portability. I don&#8217;t need to be able to journal in bed (as I happen to be at the moment) but, it shouldn&#8217;t be too much of a hassle to move said machine from office to living room to back porch. I already have a flat panel monitor, so at least if I get a desktop, I won&#8217;t be trying to lug a CRT around. That said, I&#8217;d really like to have a dual-head setup. I&#8217;d love to be typing in my &#8220;IDE&#8221; (emacs) on one monitor with a syntax guide for whatever the language-du-jour is up in the other.</p>

<p>So, here are my basic computing uses, in order of either frequency or importance:</p>

<p>1) Programming &#8212; emacs. I&#8217;ve tried emacs under Windows, and just don&#8217;t like it. I haven&#8217;t really tried a native OSX emacs, so don&#8217;t know how it would fare, though I suspect I&#8217;d like it well enough.</p>

<p>2) Email/PIM &#8212; currently, I use Novell Ximian Evolution and like it fine, but have had trouble getting my Treo 650 to sync with it under (Redhat) linux, and am not wedded to it. Oh, and I wish I had the ldap object class defintion for the contact manager in Evolution.</p>

<p>4) Surfing/Blogging &#8211; Firefox &#8212; exists just fine under OSX, Windows, and Linux</p>

<p>5) Photo/Graphic manipulation &#8212; Gimp&#8217;s getting better, but I still have a preference for photoshop &#8211; but $600 is a LOT of money for one piece of software, even one as useful as photoshop. I also need to hook up my camera; Anything with USB will suffice but a media reader for the xD card would be cool.</p>

<p>6) Remote access &#8212; I list this low because it&#8217;s not really a factor. I won&#8217;t be getting a platform that doesn&#8217;t have an ssh/sftp client whether shell (Linux/Mac) or PuTTY(Win)</p>

<p>6) Gaming &#8212; see gaming paragraph above</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and quiet. It doesn&#8217;t have to be silent, but I&#8217;d like a computer of a lesser hum.</p>

<p>How would you crack that nut? Even better, what do you recommend for me in this situation? Thanks!</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">I&rsquo;ve started using Hugo for site generation for my blog. Too long, I&rsquo;ve let it go to the weeds. Even though I&rsquo;ve taken some good precautions on the host, I&rsquo;ve failed to keep wordpress up-to-date. This has allowed script-kiddies and others with more time than quality of life to repurpose it. No longer!
With Hugo, I do site generation localy and upload static HTML. What does this mean for you? Faster page loads, and content that I actually produced.</div>

We weren&#8217;t really sure what we wanted to do today, but we had talked about doing one of the &#8220;bus to bus&#8221; walks in Brighton where you could take a bus to one of the stops and then do a country walk in the Sussex downs to somewhere else that a bus runs, and catch that back into town. As a family, we&#8217;d done the Ditchling Beacon to Devil&#8217;s Dyke walk once.</div>

Yogurt and blueberries for myself while Sam and Carolyn had Muffins with Bonne Mammon, clementines and milk. We confirmed that trains to Lewes were frequent and headed up to the station. We got our tickets there and boarded a Southern &#8220;local&#8221; train with a few stops before we even got to Lewes.</div>

I wish I were more observant about the mundane, because in some important ways, I think it&#8217;s the mudane that matters far more than the extrordinary. At least in story telling.
We left Philadelphia Thursday evening. We flew from the international terminal at PHL on USAirways. We were originally supposed to fly from A6 at one end of the terminal, and shortly after we settled down there, an announcement came over the PA that there was a gate change and we needed to switch to A23 at the other end of the terminal.</div>

I came across this posting on the python group I&#8217;m a member of on (in?) Linked In.
The first typo, was a bit awkward, but I could see how it would happen during an editing/revision session when that session wasn&#8217;t followed by a proofreading. &#8220;Our client is a leader in the worldwide leader&#8221;. So, what you&#8217;re saying is they lead?
But what actually cracked me up was the simple substitution of a &#8220;t&#8221; where a &#8220;d&#8221; should go.</div>

I still remember packing up his model trains with my dad and some of the rest of the family. The specific bit of his legacy for me. They hadn&#8217;t been unpacked since. Instead, they followed me from place to place still in the boxes we packed back then. For the past several years, they were stored with the inlaws who recently kindly suggested that maybe it was time for them to come home.</div>

It&#8217;s a handful, and like any good job, understaffed. But it&#8217;s going to be fun. And I&#8217;m going to learn lots. I&#8217;m quite excited by the undertaking.

However, I&#8217;m also not part of some ideological movement in opposition to shopping today. I just don&#8217;t like crowds. I can&#8217;t be bothered.
I was invited to a &#8220;buy nothing&#8221; day on Facebook. I suppose if the point is to raise awareness of needless consumerism, I&#8217;m a fan. But in this era of anti-capitalism, of the &#8220;99%&#8221;, I&#8217;m wary.</div>

I&#8217;m listening to my &#8220;Everything but the Girl&#8221; radio station on Pandora. As Carolyn put it, &#8220;Is it nothing but Everything But the Girl&#8221;? Pleasant enough in itself, but thanks to Lexus, I&#8217;m enjoying it as part of a free trial to Pandora One. It&#8217;s funny how it&#8217;s the little things. For no particular reason that I can think of, BMW has always been the target of my automotive lust.</div>
