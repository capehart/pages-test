              <p>I read <a HREF="http://www.aarp.org/bulletin/yourlife/many_choices.html">an interesting article</a> that my mom sent me. She sent me the paper copy from the AARP bulletin that she (apparently) receives. The gist of the article (authored by Swarthmore professor Barry Schwartz) is that the free market is good at giving consumers choices, but an abundance of choices can cause decision paralysis and dissatisfaction. These are primarily afflictions suffered by &#8220;maximizers&#8221; &#8212; people who&#8217;s goal in decision-making is to get &#8220;the best&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;satisficers&#8221; who&#8217;s goal is to be satisfied.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve done enough thinking and had enough therapy to know that, at least in most decisions I&#8217;m faced with, a <span style="font-style:italic;">right</span> decision is impossible for those of us that aren&#8217;t omniscient. We do the best we can with what the tools and knowledge we have.</p>

<p>I probably came to the concept of &#8220;good enough&#8221; first under Jack Smith at Kesmai. It&#8217;s really a simple concept, but at the time was hard to apply. I&#8217;d work on a project. Once it was good enough, and I acknowledged that it was good enough, he&#8217;d want me to task switch and work on something else. I would want to make the original project better. In just a couple of hours, I could really improve aspect X. It took me a while to get good at determining what good enough was and stopping there. Either it wasn&#8217;t good enough if aspect X wasn&#8217;t improved, or it was and therefore improving aspect X was a waste of time.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s probably most disappointing about the article is also least surprising given Schwartz&#8217;s position in the academy. Rather than suggesting tactics for becoming a &#8220;satisficer&#8221;, Schwartz instead suggests our lives are improved by fewer choices.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Limited options can be liberating, and we should value at least some constraints on our freedom of choice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He then goes on to refer to seatbelt laws &#8212; a topic (along with motorcycle helmets) I&#8217;ll have to save for a later blog.</p>

<p>The article ends a little too soon. The last paragraph is</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While it&#8217;s true that a life without any freedom of choice would not be worth living, more choices doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean greater happiness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems to me, it should read &#8220;more choices doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean greater happiness for Barry Schwartz, therefore he would like his choices limited. The only way to really limit Barry&#8217;s choices is to limit all of our choices. And we already have an organization designed to do just that. Let&#8217;s get the government to limit our choices. In the end we&#8217;ll all be happier.&#8221;</p>

<p>The concept that there is some &#8220;right&#8221; amount of choice that would maximize happiness and well-being for all Americans (or any other group) is the same sort of fuzzy thinking evident in minimum wage laws (another blog for the future). Even more troubling is the idea that even if there were some right amount of choice, that some centralized body would be the best way to determine it. I have not yet read <a HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0385503865/002-4219068-8050435?v=glance">The Wisdom of Crowds</a>, but thanks to the little bit I know of market economics certainly, I find the premise quite plausible. (The premise is that many untrained can collectively make a better decision than an elite few.)</p>

<p>So, I don&#8217;t think that the answer to the abundance of choice is government legislation limiting our freedom. Instead, I think it&#8217;s an educated consumer, and one that seeks satisfaction rather than &#8220;the best&#8221;. Artificially limiting our choice simply retards the growth and intelligence of the consumer &#8211; a poor choice as far as I&#8217;m concerned.</p>

<p>On a side, but related, note I do know people for whom these choices do cause the sort of paralysis/anxiety professor Schwartz refers to. I remember the (at least partly) humorous idea of setting up a website &#8212; www.RunCJ&#8217;sLife.com 😉</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">I&rsquo;ve started using Hugo for site generation for my blog. Too long, I&rsquo;ve let it go to the weeds. Even though I&rsquo;ve taken some good precautions on the host, I&rsquo;ve failed to keep wordpress up-to-date. This has allowed script-kiddies and others with more time than quality of life to repurpose it. No longer!
With Hugo, I do site generation localy and upload static HTML. What does this mean for you? Faster page loads, and content that I actually produced.</div>

We weren&#8217;t really sure what we wanted to do today, but we had talked about doing one of the &#8220;bus to bus&#8221; walks in Brighton where you could take a bus to one of the stops and then do a country walk in the Sussex downs to somewhere else that a bus runs, and catch that back into town. As a family, we&#8217;d done the Ditchling Beacon to Devil&#8217;s Dyke walk once.</div>

Yogurt and blueberries for myself while Sam and Carolyn had Muffins with Bonne Mammon, clementines and milk. We confirmed that trains to Lewes were frequent and headed up to the station. We got our tickets there and boarded a Southern &#8220;local&#8221; train with a few stops before we even got to Lewes.</div>

I wish I were more observant about the mundane, because in some important ways, I think it&#8217;s the mudane that matters far more than the extrordinary. At least in story telling.
We left Philadelphia Thursday evening. We flew from the international terminal at PHL on USAirways. We were originally supposed to fly from A6 at one end of the terminal, and shortly after we settled down there, an announcement came over the PA that there was a gate change and we needed to switch to A23 at the other end of the terminal.</div>

I came across this posting on the python group I&#8217;m a member of on (in?) Linked In.
The first typo, was a bit awkward, but I could see how it would happen during an editing/revision session when that session wasn&#8217;t followed by a proofreading. &#8220;Our client is a leader in the worldwide leader&#8221;. So, what you&#8217;re saying is they lead?
But what actually cracked me up was the simple substitution of a &#8220;t&#8221; where a &#8220;d&#8221; should go.</div>

I still remember packing up his model trains with my dad and some of the rest of the family. The specific bit of his legacy for me. They hadn&#8217;t been unpacked since. Instead, they followed me from place to place still in the boxes we packed back then. For the past several years, they were stored with the inlaws who recently kindly suggested that maybe it was time for them to come home.</div>

It&#8217;s a handful, and like any good job, understaffed. But it&#8217;s going to be fun. And I&#8217;m going to learn lots. I&#8217;m quite excited by the undertaking.

However, I&#8217;m also not part of some ideological movement in opposition to shopping today. I just don&#8217;t like crowds. I can&#8217;t be bothered.
I was invited to a &#8220;buy nothing&#8221; day on Facebook. I suppose if the point is to raise awareness of needless consumerism, I&#8217;m a fan. But in this era of anti-capitalism, of the &#8220;99%&#8221;, I&#8217;m wary.</div>

I&#8217;m listening to my &#8220;Everything but the Girl&#8221; radio station on Pandora. As Carolyn put it, &#8220;Is it nothing but Everything But the Girl&#8221;? Pleasant enough in itself, but thanks to Lexus, I&#8217;m enjoying it as part of a free trial to Pandora One. It&#8217;s funny how it&#8217;s the little things. For no particular reason that I can think of, BMW has always been the target of my automotive lust.</div>
