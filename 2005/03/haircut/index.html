              <p>We went to visit the inlaws over spring break. Well, my inlaws; her parents. It was nice. The Philadelphia area is different from Altoona. Plus, they take us out to nice dinners!</p>

<p>One of the many family jokes or elements of folklore, or what have you, is my penchant for barber shops. Barber shops are great. They&#8217;re almost always a source of local color, and I don&#8217;t understand paying $18 for someone at a &#8220;salon&#8221; to cut my hair when I can get it cut for almost half the price by someone with probably twice the experience.</p>

<p>Last year, as we headed to some nice restaurant or another, we passed &#8220;Duke&#8217;s barbershop&#8221; near my father-in-law&#8217;s office, and someone suggested I get my hair cut there. Having not found (and to be fair, not really searched for) a satisfactory barber in Altoona, and needing a haircut when were last in the area over the winter break, I went to &#8220;Dukes.&#8221; It was almost everything I expected. I waited with 2-3 other men. Not one of them was less than twice my age. There were two chairs, but only one barber. The barber carried on a friendly banter with the customers. The only way I was surprised was that the barber was a woman.</p>

<p>Apparently, &#8220;Duke&#8221; had opened up a new place and was working there, and this woman was now the barber in the original location.</p>

<p>Having still not found (and still not sought) a barber in Altoona, I again headed to Duke&#8217;s when we were with the inlaws. Only this time the original Duke&#8217;s was closed. Instead there was a sign indicating one should go to the new location. It even said to mention this notice (which I did) and receive a $2 discount (which I did not). So, I went to the new Duke&#8217;s where I got my haircut by the real Duke.</p>

<p>That was a lot of preamble to get to the real story, but such is the way when I get typing.</p>

<p>The state of things with the two stores came up early in the conversation. The woman Duke had put in charge of the store allegedly cheated Duke badly. Duke had not been hurt like that since his mom died. Not only that, there was something not so very good with the former landlord. And she&#8217;d been giving out hugs and &#8220;must have hugged the right people.&#8221; Duke was preparing some choice words for said landlord, but the ex-cop getting his haircut before me suggested it was best to walk away and not confront said individual. Said individual had a rep, and you just don&#8217;t want to get mixed up in that. Take what you&#8217;ve got, and be thankful.</p>

<p>Duke&#8217;s wife came in to pick up a TV that needed to go back to the old location. Duke repeated the advice of the ex-cop to her. She moaned about having to &#8220;be the good guy&#8221; and how often she had to do that. I don&#8217;t know that I believed the angelic claims burbling from between her clenched teeth.</p>

<p>Fortunately, that topic passed. The ex-cop left not long after a buddy of his arrived. Like Altoona, everyone (else) in the barber shop had lived in the area their whole lives. The buddy, with jet black, slicked back hair picked up the newspaper and called about a car. He talked glowingly of his recently &#8220;restored&#8221; &#8217;86 Chevy Camero IROC Z 28 &#8212; a restoration that seemed to consist of little more than replacing the blown engine and spending almost as much on rims as on the vehicle itself.</p>

<p>The conversation got around to where I was from. When Altoona was discovered, buddy said &#8220;Oh, I know where that is! Near Johnstown!&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnstown is about 50 miles away and I&#8217;m sure that things as little as 5 miles away from buddy&#8217;s home are not &#8220;near&#8221; him. Still, as Altoona&#8217;s not really &#8220;near&#8221; anything, I concur that that&#8217;s exactly right.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easy livin&#8217; up there!&#8221; buddy continues. I agreed that the cost of living was not very high. I didn&#8217;t allow as to the possible relationship between said cost of living and the fact that it&#8217;s freakin&#8217; cold, and miles and miles from anyplace that passes as urbane. Buddy wondered if it was a job that had lead me there, and I confirmed that it was the case, though a job for my wife with the university and all. &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s sweet. Easy livin&#8217; and with regular income!&#8221; He was almost salivating. When the conversation got around to where my wife was from, and I said &#8220;Gradyville.&#8221; Again, a punctuating &#8220;Oh, I know where that is! Near the state park!&#8221; shot from buddy&#8217;s mouth. &#8220;They got some nice houses up there. I guess your wife&#8217;s had it easy her whole life!&#8221; I agreed that she had a pretty good life.</p>

<p>Thinking of my wife&#8217;s &#8220;easy life,&#8221; I left the barber shop with a smile on my face, a cute story, and a damn fine haircut.</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">I&rsquo;ve started using Hugo for site generation for my blog. Too long, I&rsquo;ve let it go to the weeds. Even though I&rsquo;ve taken some good precautions on the host, I&rsquo;ve failed to keep wordpress up-to-date. This has allowed script-kiddies and others with more time than quality of life to repurpose it. No longer!
With Hugo, I do site generation localy and upload static HTML. What does this mean for you? Faster page loads, and content that I actually produced.</div>

We weren&#8217;t really sure what we wanted to do today, but we had talked about doing one of the &#8220;bus to bus&#8221; walks in Brighton where you could take a bus to one of the stops and then do a country walk in the Sussex downs to somewhere else that a bus runs, and catch that back into town. As a family, we&#8217;d done the Ditchling Beacon to Devil&#8217;s Dyke walk once.</div>

Yogurt and blueberries for myself while Sam and Carolyn had Muffins with Bonne Mammon, clementines and milk. We confirmed that trains to Lewes were frequent and headed up to the station. We got our tickets there and boarded a Southern &#8220;local&#8221; train with a few stops before we even got to Lewes.</div>

I wish I were more observant about the mundane, because in some important ways, I think it&#8217;s the mudane that matters far more than the extrordinary. At least in story telling.
We left Philadelphia Thursday evening. We flew from the international terminal at PHL on USAirways. We were originally supposed to fly from A6 at one end of the terminal, and shortly after we settled down there, an announcement came over the PA that there was a gate change and we needed to switch to A23 at the other end of the terminal.</div>

I came across this posting on the python group I&#8217;m a member of on (in?) Linked In.
The first typo, was a bit awkward, but I could see how it would happen during an editing/revision session when that session wasn&#8217;t followed by a proofreading. &#8220;Our client is a leader in the worldwide leader&#8221;. So, what you&#8217;re saying is they lead?
But what actually cracked me up was the simple substitution of a &#8220;t&#8221; where a &#8220;d&#8221; should go.</div>

I still remember packing up his model trains with my dad and some of the rest of the family. The specific bit of his legacy for me. They hadn&#8217;t been unpacked since. Instead, they followed me from place to place still in the boxes we packed back then. For the past several years, they were stored with the inlaws who recently kindly suggested that maybe it was time for them to come home.</div>

It&#8217;s a handful, and like any good job, understaffed. But it&#8217;s going to be fun. And I&#8217;m going to learn lots. I&#8217;m quite excited by the undertaking.

However, I&#8217;m also not part of some ideological movement in opposition to shopping today. I just don&#8217;t like crowds. I can&#8217;t be bothered.
I was invited to a &#8220;buy nothing&#8221; day on Facebook. I suppose if the point is to raise awareness of needless consumerism, I&#8217;m a fan. But in this era of anti-capitalism, of the &#8220;99%&#8221;, I&#8217;m wary.</div>

I&#8217;m listening to my &#8220;Everything but the Girl&#8221; radio station on Pandora. As Carolyn put it, &#8220;Is it nothing but Everything But the Girl&#8221;? Pleasant enough in itself, but thanks to Lexus, I&#8217;m enjoying it as part of a free trial to Pandora One. It&#8217;s funny how it&#8217;s the little things. For no particular reason that I can think of, BMW has always been the target of my automotive lust.</div>
