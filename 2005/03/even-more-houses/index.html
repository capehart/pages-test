              <p>Well, we finally engaged a real estate agent. We met with her (and an associated mortgage person) on Thursday, and put together a list of houses to see which we did, today.</p>

<p>We saw a total of 5. Of those five, it breaks down like this:</p>

<p>#1 Nice, everything we need, more on it later.</p>

<p>#2 Funky. Old. Sideways-looking. Awesome neighborhood. Awesome hardwood floors. Semi-renovated. Too expensive. Sucky closets. Only heat in basement was wood stove.</p>

<p>#3 Nice. Taxes too high. Dark, dark kitchen cabinets, pretty good space, though not great flow.</p>

<p>#4 Old. In bad shape. Awesome original woodwork. Awesome 6-foot windows with interior wood shutters. Currently a duplex. If we had a lot of money now, or even a regularly excessive income stream, this could be a DREAM renovation. I can imagine doing to this what &#8220;the girls&#8221; did to 1848 Grace street. (If you don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;ll tell you later.) Busy street. No garage. I&#8217;m really tempted by this because I see such enormous potential. But it would cost so much to achieve that potential, that even though we&#8217;d probably have no trouble getting it back (good neighborhood in cute town), it would be more than we&#8217;d really want to put into living quarters.</p>

<p>#5 Regularly updated. Near Sylvan hills between Hollidaysburg and Altoona. Hot tub, swings. The pool table conveys. Pretty neat space except for the bedroom area. But we would be wanting to spend some time in the bedroom area too. A little too expensive for what we think we&#8217;d be getting.</p>

<p>So, after all that, we are only really interested in number 1. #4 is tempting, definitely, but more so if we were at a different stage of our lives.</p>

<p>&#8220;#1&#8221; is actually &#8220;512 28th Ave.&#8221; and I took <a href="http://gallery.accapehart.com/51228thave">a lot of pictures..</a> It was built in &#8217;65. It&#8217;s 3 bedroom, 2.5 ba (actually, 1 + <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> +<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ba). It has a one-car garage and adjacent workshop. It&#8217;s got a large finished basement area with a half bath, a separate counter top with sink and fridge. Between ample closets, basement space and a funky-attic-like-thing tucked behind the closets of the upstairs bedrooms, it seems to have ample storage. It&#8217;s got a nice kitchen with a bar between it and the den which has a gas fireplace in it. The Master bedroom (and <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> bath) are on the first floor with the laundry. It&#8217;s got a smallish and slopey lot, but nice enough to do some playing/hanging out in. It&#8217;s got a screened in back porch. Gas hot water baseboard heat with 3 zones. City water/sewer, central vac, thermopane windows, all brick exterior. 1912 sq feet above ground, and 800 below. No central air. It&#8217;s on a cul-de-sac. The asking price is $155K.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re tempted. Very tempted. While it would be simple enough to add a cooktop/range to the downstairs, and make it it&#8217;s own in-law-apartment, The downstairs doesn&#8217;t get enough light to have it be something Eve would be interested in staying in, so we can&#8217;t use her money. Still, we should probably be able to take care of that. If we borrow $120K at about 5.5%, that means P+I would be in the neighborhood of $680/mo. Pretend about $250/mo for taxes+insurance&#8230; About $930 per mo. More than the $700/mo we&#8217;re paying now in rent, but almost certainly a doable sum.</p>

<p>I guess the next step will be to find out typical gas bills and ask our agent Wilma how low she thinks we could get away with offering. We&#8217;ll certainly still look around, but I got a good feeling about this place.</p>

<p>OK, I could do without the salmon living room, and maybe some carpet in the basement would make it feel a little more inviting, but this are minor things compared to the walls we&#8217;d have to remove, etc. to make #4 the place we&#8217;d want it to be. And I&#8217;m nervous about the heating. I remember radiators from my childhood, but all I really know as an adult is gas forced air (and central a/c). OK. And it&#8217;s plaster walls. I&#8217;m not as sure about how to deal with them as I am drywall. There&#8217;s some dark paneling that we&#8217;d probably want to replace. But all of these things are minor compared to the flow of the space, the ease of MBR+kitchen+laundry all on the same floor, etc, etc. It&#8217;s easy livin&#8217; in altoona, all over again! 🙂</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">I&rsquo;ve started using Hugo for site generation for my blog. Too long, I&rsquo;ve let it go to the weeds. Even though I&rsquo;ve taken some good precautions on the host, I&rsquo;ve failed to keep wordpress up-to-date. This has allowed script-kiddies and others with more time than quality of life to repurpose it. No longer!
With Hugo, I do site generation localy and upload static HTML. What does this mean for you? Faster page loads, and content that I actually produced.</div>

We weren&#8217;t really sure what we wanted to do today, but we had talked about doing one of the &#8220;bus to bus&#8221; walks in Brighton where you could take a bus to one of the stops and then do a country walk in the Sussex downs to somewhere else that a bus runs, and catch that back into town. As a family, we&#8217;d done the Ditchling Beacon to Devil&#8217;s Dyke walk once.</div>

Yogurt and blueberries for myself while Sam and Carolyn had Muffins with Bonne Mammon, clementines and milk. We confirmed that trains to Lewes were frequent and headed up to the station. We got our tickets there and boarded a Southern &#8220;local&#8221; train with a few stops before we even got to Lewes.</div>

I wish I were more observant about the mundane, because in some important ways, I think it&#8217;s the mudane that matters far more than the extrordinary. At least in story telling.
We left Philadelphia Thursday evening. We flew from the international terminal at PHL on USAirways. We were originally supposed to fly from A6 at one end of the terminal, and shortly after we settled down there, an announcement came over the PA that there was a gate change and we needed to switch to A23 at the other end of the terminal.</div>

I came across this posting on the python group I&#8217;m a member of on (in?) Linked In.
The first typo, was a bit awkward, but I could see how it would happen during an editing/revision session when that session wasn&#8217;t followed by a proofreading. &#8220;Our client is a leader in the worldwide leader&#8221;. So, what you&#8217;re saying is they lead?
But what actually cracked me up was the simple substitution of a &#8220;t&#8221; where a &#8220;d&#8221; should go.</div>

I still remember packing up his model trains with my dad and some of the rest of the family. The specific bit of his legacy for me. They hadn&#8217;t been unpacked since. Instead, they followed me from place to place still in the boxes we packed back then. For the past several years, they were stored with the inlaws who recently kindly suggested that maybe it was time for them to come home.</div>

It&#8217;s a handful, and like any good job, understaffed. But it&#8217;s going to be fun. And I&#8217;m going to learn lots. I&#8217;m quite excited by the undertaking.

However, I&#8217;m also not part of some ideological movement in opposition to shopping today. I just don&#8217;t like crowds. I can&#8217;t be bothered.
I was invited to a &#8220;buy nothing&#8221; day on Facebook. I suppose if the point is to raise awareness of needless consumerism, I&#8217;m a fan. But in this era of anti-capitalism, of the &#8220;99%&#8221;, I&#8217;m wary.</div>

I&#8217;m listening to my &#8220;Everything but the Girl&#8221; radio station on Pandora. As Carolyn put it, &#8220;Is it nothing but Everything But the Girl&#8221;? Pleasant enough in itself, but thanks to Lexus, I&#8217;m enjoying it as part of a free trial to Pandora One. It&#8217;s funny how it&#8217;s the little things. For no particular reason that I can think of, BMW has always been the target of my automotive lust.</div>
