              <p>I had written something like this earlier, but it disappeared into the ether with a 500 Error from blogger.com. What follows is a re-creation, doubtless somewhat more organized, but less impassioned than the original.)</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t like folding laundry. And I don&#8217;t understand folding proteins. But, thanks to <a href="http://folding.stanford.edu/">Folding@Home</a> I&#8217;m now doing my part toward their goal <span style="font-style: italic;">to understand protein folding, protein aggregation, and related diseases</span>. But, it&#8217;s not the hidden-bio-geek in me that&#8217;s enjoying this. (I doubt even the presence of a hidden-bio-geek in me.) No, it&#8217;s the gamer.</p>

<p>While there is nothing game-like to the interface or the application, <span style="font-style: italic;">Folding@Home</span> has many of the trappings of a good game. And I don&#8217;t just mean some of their terminology (&#8220;points&#8221; and &#8220;teams&#8221;), but the application of those concepts. It&#8217;s true that I get a kick out of earning points. But primarily because those points <span style="font-weight: bold;">mean</span> something. Let me explain. My primary personal linux box (the one you&#8217;re reading this blog from) is a 600 MHz Celeron &#8212; as of this writing top of the line machines are approximately 6-7 times faster in terms of clock speed not to mention several architectural improvements. So, no computational powerhouse, but good enough for what I&#8217;m having it do. It took most of a week for that machine to finish a single work unit for Folding@Home. A week&#8217;s worth of <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> computation feels like something substantial to me. Even on my 600MHz box. So, I <span style="font-weight: bold;">earned</span> those points.</p>

<p><a href="http://vspx27.stanford.edu/awards/cert.php?u=capehart&amp;pts=241"><img src="http://vspx27.stanford.edu/awards/cert.php?u=capehart&pts=241" alt="AC's certificate." align="right" border="0" height="120" width="160" /></a>But having points, even hard-earned ones, by itself is not enough. Not for a game to be good. Those points have to give you bragging rights. I&#8217;ve gotta be able to show off my shiny new suit of armor so that you can gaze at me with envy. Well, fortunately for the game under consideration, I not only earned those points, I even get a certificate that I can (among other things) put directly in my blog!</p>

<p>So, we&#8217;ve got points and status. That&#8217;s good. And, there&#8217;s rank within the game itself. That&#8217;s helpful, but rank among hundreds of thousands matters mainly to those few at the top. It&#8217;s just too big to matter to my 600MHz Celeron-self.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we also have <span style="font-style: italic;">clans</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">guilds</span> or, in Folding@Home vocab, <span style="font-style: italic;">teams</span>. In <span style="font-weight: bold;">Legends of Kesmai</span> (RIP) I was in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Wulf</span> guild. I never played quite enough Half-Life to join a clan, though several co-workers were a fairly formidable force. The only reason I even found out about Folding@Home was a clan leader promoting his clan on a mailing list I&#8217;m on. (Sorry, I mean enthusiast promoting his team!) So, I &#8220;joined&#8221; the <a href="http://www.cvillefolding.org/">Charlottesville Folding Society</a>. And this is good game design too. Because not only do my computing cycles help out, they give props to my clan!</p>

<p>That would have been good, just right there. What makes it great is that we&#8217;re ranked WITHIN clan as well. I&#8217;m near the bottom, of course. After all, I just started, and did I mention the 600 MHz Celeron? But Charlottesville&#8217;s tech-media darling Waldo Jaquith appeard to have started at about the same time. And, perhaps enitely unknown to him, <a href="http://vspx27.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/main.py?qtype=userpage&amp;teamnum=41260&amp;username=Waldo%5FJaquith">he</a> and <a href="http://vspx27.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/main.py?qtype=userpage&amp;username=capehart">I</a> are now in competition. He finished a work unit first and got on the boards early. I only recently finished my first, but it was worth several more points, so I jumped into the lead. He just finished his second, so he&#8217;s surpassed me again. But I&#8217;ve thrown other clunker machines of mine into the mix. He&#8217;ll be in for a rude surpise from me soon, I can tell you! And that&#8217;s what makes this fun, and why I&#8217;ll continue to donate work units past the first to Folding@Home. I don&#8217;t care about doing more work units than <a href="http://vspx27.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/main.py?qtype=userpage&amp;username=MidnightFreak%5BH%5D">MidnightFreak</a>. It&#8217;ll never happen, anyway. But&#8230; if I can beat Waldo! That&#8217;d be cool. I know and like Waldo.</p>

<p>So, congratulations to Folding@Home. The best game I never played.</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">I&rsquo;ve started using Hugo for site generation for my blog. Too long, I&rsquo;ve let it go to the weeds. Even though I&rsquo;ve taken some good precautions on the host, I&rsquo;ve failed to keep wordpress up-to-date. This has allowed script-kiddies and others with more time than quality of life to repurpose it. No longer!
With Hugo, I do site generation localy and upload static HTML. What does this mean for you? Faster page loads, and content that I actually produced.</div>

We weren&#8217;t really sure what we wanted to do today, but we had talked about doing one of the &#8220;bus to bus&#8221; walks in Brighton where you could take a bus to one of the stops and then do a country walk in the Sussex downs to somewhere else that a bus runs, and catch that back into town. As a family, we&#8217;d done the Ditchling Beacon to Devil&#8217;s Dyke walk once.</div>

Yogurt and blueberries for myself while Sam and Carolyn had Muffins with Bonne Mammon, clementines and milk. We confirmed that trains to Lewes were frequent and headed up to the station. We got our tickets there and boarded a Southern &#8220;local&#8221; train with a few stops before we even got to Lewes.</div>

I wish I were more observant about the mundane, because in some important ways, I think it&#8217;s the mudane that matters far more than the extrordinary. At least in story telling.
We left Philadelphia Thursday evening. We flew from the international terminal at PHL on USAirways. We were originally supposed to fly from A6 at one end of the terminal, and shortly after we settled down there, an announcement came over the PA that there was a gate change and we needed to switch to A23 at the other end of the terminal.</div>

I came across this posting on the python group I&#8217;m a member of on (in?) Linked In.
The first typo, was a bit awkward, but I could see how it would happen during an editing/revision session when that session wasn&#8217;t followed by a proofreading. &#8220;Our client is a leader in the worldwide leader&#8221;. So, what you&#8217;re saying is they lead?
But what actually cracked me up was the simple substitution of a &#8220;t&#8221; where a &#8220;d&#8221; should go.</div>

I still remember packing up his model trains with my dad and some of the rest of the family. The specific bit of his legacy for me. They hadn&#8217;t been unpacked since. Instead, they followed me from place to place still in the boxes we packed back then.

I was invited to a &#8220;buy nothing&#8221; day on Facebook. I suppose if the point is to raise awareness of needless consumerism, I&#8217;m a fan. But in this era of anti-capitalism, of the &#8220;99%&#8221;, I&#8217;m wary.</div>

I&#8217;m listening to my &#8220;Everything but the Girl&#8221; radio station on Pandora. As Carolyn put it, &#8220;Is it nothing but Everything But the Girl&#8221;? Pleasant enough in itself, but thanks to Lexus, I&#8217;m enjoying it as part of a free trial to Pandora One. It&#8217;s funny how it&#8217;s the little things.
