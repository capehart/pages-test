              <p>Today I was driving around south-east Baltimore along some busy-ish highway (695?) (97?) when the two lanes of traffic I was in went down to one due to construction. The signs said that the right lane was closed in <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> mile, merge left. I was already in the left lane, so in good shape. As other drivers heeded the warning and worked their way left, the left lane became more crowded and slower. The right lane emptier, and therefore quicker.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.accapehart.com/images/merge_left.gif" width="120" height="120" align="right" />I&#8217;m a &#8220;let&#8217;s all get along&#8221; kinda person, so I stay in the left lane, but every now and again, I see someone who has made the other choice, and that gets me riled up. The reason the left lane is slower (besides simply being denser traffic) is that where the actual cones start to block the right lane, people finally MUST merge so they push their way into the left lane. Obviously, this slows down everyone in the left lane who must pause to let these late-comers in. I think it is rude to rush ahead for your own gain if it slows everyone else down.</p>

<p>There is a solution, of sorts. Don&#8217;t let people in who behave that way. If all of us <span style="font-style: italic;">cooperative</span> types agreed to punish the <span style="font-style: italic;">me-firsts</span>, then it would no longer pay to be a <span style="font-style: italic;">me-first</span> because even if you raced ahead in the closing lane making time relative to everyone else, you&#8217;d lose it not being able to get back into the flow. Alas, many of us are also <span style="font-style: italic;">nice</span>. &#8220;We&#8217;re here at the convergence, we all need to get to the other side, the person in the big SUV is pushing their way in, might as well let him go.&#8221;</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.accapehart.com/images/roadrage.jpg" align="left" height="83" width="109" />I decided to be <span style="font-style: italic;">cooperative</span>, but not <span style="font-style: italic;">nice</span>. Anyone who wanted into the left lane while there was free road ahead of them on the right was welcomed in before me. But, when I got to the convergence, I stayed tight on the tail of the car in front of me, not letting in any of the <span style="font-style: italic;">me-firsts</span>. This behavior pissed off a <span style="font-style: italic;">me-first</span> in a big SUV who felt like it was his turn since the progression into the single lane had been left-right-left up to that point, so he started merging in, coming ever closer to me. Most people with a healthy regard for their safety and a preference for a non-damaged vehicle would simply have backed off and let <span style="font-style: italic;">me-first</span> in. But I&#8217;d made a decision. I&#8217;d teach <span style="font-style: italic;">me-first</span> a lesson. He couldn&#8217;t slow all the rest of us down with impunity.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sad to report that he didn&#8217;t see the error of his ways and repent. The driver of the car behind me must have had a healthy regard for his safety or a preference for a non-damaged vehicle. He let <span style="font-style: italic;">me-first</span> in.</p>

<p>After we cleared the construction, and got back up to speed, I got over into the right lane. As the signs on the PA Turnpike say: &#8220;Drive Right, Pass Left. It&#8217;s the law!&#8221; Me-first takes this as an opportunity to pass me. As soon as he&#8217;s past me, he gets into my lane in front of me and brakes sharply. Not enough so that I&#8217;d actually hit him. Though since his car is newer and more expensive, and he did <span style="font-style: italic;">just</span> pass me, the thought at least passes through my mind that maybe I should go ahead and hit him. But I don&#8217;t. I break. I downshift. And, at the next exit, he roars off and we never cross paths again.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m quite sure that he was teaching me a lesson to &#8220;be nice&#8221; at convergences where two lanes have to come together. Take turns and go left-right-left-right. So, each of us comes away from that construction with a feeling of &#8220;those damn jerks on the road&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8217;ll teach him a lesson.&#8221;</p>

<p>For those familiar with game theory, this is a reasonable map to the prisoner&#8217;s dilemma. However, that only works if each party recognizes each interaction. <span style="font-style: italic;">Me-first</span> and I got into a retaliatory punishment cycle, albeit a short one. I think he wronged me first by failing to heed the warning and make his way left. I suspect he thinks I wronged him first by not giving him his &#8220;rightful&#8221; place in the intermingling of lanes.</p>

<p>One of my therapy struggles has been how to be content and still strive. I think this is related. How to be zen and still bastard enough not to get fucked over.</p>

<p>I know few people read my blog. Especially as I&#8217;ve not yet made it known to more than a couple people who might be interested in it, but if you do read this (and make it this far), I&#8217;d be curious to know your behavior at merge points. To the extent you can separate your stated from your demonstrated preferences, I&#8217;d love to know that too. I&#8217;ve clearly stated my preference above. My demonstrated preferences are far from as lilly-white. I&#8217;ve been a <span style="font-style: italic;">me-first</span> on occasion too. But at least I have an awareness of what a jerk I&#8217;m being 🙂</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">I&rsquo;ve started using Hugo for site generation for my blog. Too long, I&rsquo;ve let it go to the weeds. Even though I&rsquo;ve taken some good precautions on the host, I&rsquo;ve failed to keep wordpress up-to-date. This has allowed script-kiddies and others with more time than quality of life to repurpose it. No longer!
With Hugo, I do site generation localy and upload static HTML. What does this mean for you? Faster page loads, and content that I actually produced.</div>

We weren&#8217;t really sure what we wanted to do today, but we had talked about doing one of the &#8220;bus to bus&#8221; walks in Brighton where you could take a bus to one of the stops and then do a country walk in the Sussex downs to somewhere else that a bus runs, and catch that back into town. As a family, we&#8217;d done the Ditchling Beacon to Devil&#8217;s Dyke walk once.</div>

Yogurt and blueberries for myself while Sam and Carolyn had Muffins with Bonne Mammon, clementines and milk. We confirmed that trains to Lewes were frequent and headed up to the station. We got our tickets there and boarded a Southern &#8220;local&#8221; train with a few stops before we even got to Lewes.</div>

I wish I were more observant about the mundane, because in some important ways, I think it&#8217;s the mudane that matters far more than the extrordinary. At least in story telling.
We left Philadelphia Thursday evening. We flew from the international terminal at PHL on USAirways. We were originally supposed to fly from A6 at one end of the terminal, and shortly after we settled down there, an announcement came over the PA that there was a gate change and we needed to switch to A23 at the other end of the terminal.</div>

I came across this posting on the python group I&#8217;m a member of on (in?) Linked In.
The first typo, was a bit awkward, but I could see how it would happen during an editing/revision session when that session wasn&#8217;t followed by a proofreading. &#8220;Our client is a leader in the worldwide leader&#8221;. So, what you&#8217;re saying is they lead?
But what actually cracked me up was the simple substitution of a &#8220;t&#8221; where a &#8220;d&#8221; should go.</div>

I still remember packing up his model trains with my dad and some of the rest of the family. The specific bit of his legacy for me. They hadn&#8217;t been unpacked since. Instead, they followed me from place to place still in the boxes we packed back then. For the past several years, they were stored with the inlaws who recently kindly suggested that maybe it was time for them to come home.</div>

However, I&#8217;m also not part of some ideological movement in opposition to shopping today. I just don&#8217;t like crowds. I can&#8217;t be bothered.
I was invited to a &#8220;buy nothing&#8221; day on Facebook. I suppose if the point is to raise awareness of needless consumerism, I&#8217;m a fan. But in this era of anti-capitalism, of the &#8220;99%&#8221;, I&#8217;m wary.</div>

I&#8217;m listening to my &#8220;Everything but the Girl&#8221; radio station on Pandora. As Carolyn put it, &#8220;Is it nothing but Everything But the Girl&#8221;? Pleasant enough in itself, but thanks to Lexus, I&#8217;m enjoying it as part of a free trial to Pandora One. It&#8217;s funny how it&#8217;s the little things. For no particular reason that I can think of, BMW has always been the target of my automotive lust.</div>
