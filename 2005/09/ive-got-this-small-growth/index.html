              <p>Carolyn and I had a perinatal day today. We had a fetal ultrasound with biophysical profile. We had an OB/GYN appointment. We had a quote <strong>&#8220;</strong>non-stress<strong>&#8220;</strong> test. Carolyn peed in a cup. (OK, to be fair, she has to pee in a cup every time we go to the OB/GYN [at their request, not her whim], but still, it was a long-ish day of poking and prodding.)</p>

<p>All of this (well most of this) because she&#8217;s &#8220;measuring small.&#8221; We had a joke at the beginning that &#8220;I make big babies.&#8221; Apparently, this is not the case. Or at least not the case for babies I make with Carolyn. This is fortunate, because little Carolyn would have some real trouble with a big baby. What was particularly curious and nerve-wracking about today was that the baby&#8217;s falling behind in the curve. Every ultrasound that we had through the end of July was the same: <em>&#8220;Baby&#8217;s doing great. I&#8217;m showing the due date as Oct. 5.&#8221;</em> I mean, they were measuring her to the <strong>day</strong>! But out of the blue, today&#8217;s ultrasound shows her as between 2 and 3 <strong>weeks</strong> behind. Somehow baby was right on track for 30 weeks, then only grew about 2 weeks worth in the last 5.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m aprehensive. I&#8217;m not yet panicked, or even really nervous, but I am aprehensive. We&#8217;ve taken a lot on faith so far, declining tests that were suggested because, by turning 35 during the pregnancy, Carolyn has reached &#8220;advanced maternal age.&#8221; So, I&#8217;m pretty willing to extend that faith to this. But, at the same time, I don&#8217;t want faith to blind me to the needs of my child. If there&#8217;s something I need to be doing to ensure his or her wellbeing, I want to be doing it.</p>

<p>At this point, we delayed having to drive about an hour away to go to the recommended regional perinatologist. I guess we&#8217;ll go next week, if the regular ultrasound shows the baby as having fallen sufficiently below the expected growth curve. Apparently, we can get a &#8220;level 2&#8221; ultrasound from this guy. One of the midwives said that &#8220;<em>His ultrasound can make out the eyelashes on a rock.&#8221;</em> I can&#8217;t tell if that&#8217;s a good thing or not since most rocks that I know about don&#8217;t have eyelashes. The recommendation to drive an hour away to the perinatologist is interesting given that we&#8217;re not supposed to travel more than an hour away from our chosen birth hospital during the last month of the pregnancy. I guess if we&#8217;re going to travel somewhere during this time, to a perinatologist is the safest place to go. But, probably one of the least fun places.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s interesting too, because we&#8217;re starting to come across stories of people who gave birth not even as far along into the pregnancy as Carolyn now is. We&#8217;re definitely not ready. I guess this weekend we&#8217;ll at least pack our hospital bags so that we&#8217;ll be at least a little bit more ready. Oh, and if you were one of those very thoughtful people who gave us baby stuff (either at the shower, or otherwise), a thank-you card will find its way to you. Eventually, I promise.</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">I&rsquo;ve started using Hugo for site generation for my blog. Too long, I&rsquo;ve let it go to the weeds. Even though I&rsquo;ve taken some good precautions on the host, I&rsquo;ve failed to keep wordpress up-to-date. This has allowed script-kiddies and others with more time than quality of life to repurpose it. No longer!
With Hugo, I do site generation localy and upload static HTML. What does this mean for you? Faster page loads, and content that I actually produced.</div>

We weren&#8217;t really sure what we wanted to do today, but we had talked about doing one of the &#8220;bus to bus&#8221; walks in Brighton where you could take a bus to one of the stops and then do a country walk in the Sussex downs to somewhere else that a bus runs, and catch that back into town. As a family, we&#8217;d done the Ditchling Beacon to Devil&#8217;s Dyke walk once.</div>

Yogurt and blueberries for myself while Sam and Carolyn had Muffins with Bonne Mammon, clementines and milk. We confirmed that trains to Lewes were frequent and headed up to the station. We got our tickets there and boarded a Southern &#8220;local&#8221; train with a few stops before we even got to Lewes.</div>

I wish I were more observant about the mundane, because in some important ways, I think it&#8217;s the mudane that matters far more than the extrordinary. At least in story telling.
We left Philadelphia Thursday evening. We flew from the international terminal at PHL on USAirways. We were originally supposed to fly from A6 at one end of the terminal, and shortly after we settled down there, an announcement came over the PA that there was a gate change and we needed to switch to A23 at the other end of the terminal.</div>

I came across this posting on the python group I&#8217;m a member of on (in?) Linked In.
The first typo, was a bit awkward, but I could see how it would happen during an editing/revision session when that session wasn&#8217;t followed by a proofreading. &#8220;Our client is a leader in the worldwide leader&#8221;. So, what you&#8217;re saying is they lead?
But what actually cracked me up was the simple substitution of a &#8220;t&#8221; where a &#8220;d&#8221; should go.</div>

I still remember packing up his model trains with my dad and some of the rest of the family. The specific bit of his legacy for me. They hadn&#8217;t been unpacked since. Instead, they followed me from place to place still in the boxes we packed back then. For the past several years, they were stored with the inlaws who recently kindly suggested that maybe it was time for them to come home.</div>

It&#8217;s a handful, and like any good job, understaffed. But it&#8217;s going to be fun. And I&#8217;m going to learn lots. I&#8217;m quite excited by the undertaking.

However, I&#8217;m also not part of some ideological movement in opposition to shopping today. I just don&#8217;t like crowds. I can&#8217;t be bothered.
I was invited to a &#8220;buy nothing&#8221; day on Facebook. I suppose if the point is to raise awareness of needless consumerism, I&#8217;m a fan. But in this era of anti-capitalism, of the &#8220;99%&#8221;, I&#8217;m wary.</div>

I&#8217;m listening to my &#8220;Everything but the Girl&#8221; radio station on Pandora. As Carolyn put it, &#8220;Is it nothing but Everything But the Girl&#8221;? Pleasant enough in itself, but thanks to Lexus, I&#8217;m enjoying it as part of a free trial to Pandora One. It&#8217;s funny how it&#8217;s the little things. For no particular reason that I can think of, BMW has always been the target of my automotive lust.</div>
