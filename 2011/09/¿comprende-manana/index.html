    <div class="article-content">
      <p>On the invitation of Sam&#8217;s <strike>soccer</strike> football coach from <a href="http://http://westcitysoccer.com/">West City Soccer</a> with whom we play &#8220;Family Futbol&#8221;, I have joined a Co-Rec soccer league with <a href="https://www.socaspot.org/">SOCA</a>. If I&#8217;m not the oldest player on the team, I&#8217;m pretty close. This team has a reserved field on Wednesdays for practice. We had our first practice last week, and there were maybe 6 or so team members who came out to practice. We did a little bit of practice on corner kicks, but it pretty quickly devolved into a small pick-up game. A couple of other neighborhood folks (all hispanic) showed up and joined us which helped liven the game up.</p>

<p><img src="http://gallery.accapehart.com/d/33829-5/092511.JPG" alt="Team Uno Player" />This week, it was a slightly different story. 3 people from the SOCA team showed up, and 15-or-so hispanics did. This meant the game went a little differently. Based on the previous week&#8217;s match, I&#8217;d worn a white shirt and brought a dark one. That&#8217;s not the way they play. Instead, we all lined up and were divided into teams even/odd down the line. Play began in a somewhat disorganized fashion, and I didn&#8217;t understand until we lost the first goal that by loosing the first goal, we also lost our shirts.</p>

<p>It made it easier to tell who was on my team, but it also meant running around feeling naked for most of the game. Still, it was a fun game. Due to circumstances, I found myself rather forward in the field at one point. A shot was taken from the other side. The goalie deflected it and it came toward me. I put a boot on it and knocked it in. A few other times, I managed to get a foot on it a few other times, and seemed to be a well respected member of my team. This was confirmed at the end of the game when one of the team leaders called out to me, &#8220;Amigo!&#8221; and pointed at the field. &#8220;MaÃ±ana! Â¿Comprende maÃ±ana?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Si. Comprendo maÃ±ana.&#8221;</p>
