      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started using Hugo for site generation for my blog. Too long, I&amp;rsquo;ve let it go to the weeds. Even though I&amp;rsquo;ve taken some good precautions on the host, I&amp;rsquo;ve failed to keep wordpress up-to-date. This has allowed script-kiddies and others with more time than quality of life to repurpose it. No longer!
With Hugo, I do site generation localy and upload static HTML. What does this mean for you? Faster page loads, and content that I actually produced.</description>

      <description>Sunday. We weren&amp;#8217;t really sure what we wanted to do today, but we had talked about doing one of the &amp;#8220;bus to bus&amp;#8221; walks in Brighton where you could take a bus to one of the stops and then do a country walk in the Sussex downs to somewhere else that a bus runs, and catch that back into town. As a family, we&amp;#8217;d done the Ditchling Beacon to Devil&amp;#8217;s Dyke walk once.</description>

      <description>Saturday, we awoke late after a mixed night&amp;#8217;s sleep. We ate our breakfast procured from Waitrose the day before. Yogurt and blueberries for myself while Sam and Carolyn had Muffins with Bonne Mammon, clementines and milk. We confirmed that trains to Lewes were frequent and headed up to the station. We got our tickets there and boarded a Southern &amp;#8220;local&amp;#8221; train with a few stops before we even got to Lewes.</description>

      <description>Alas, there was no day 1 post, so this will have to suffice for both, at least for now.
I wish I were more observant about the mundane, because in some important ways, I think it&amp;#8217;s the mudane that matters far more than the extrordinary. At least in story telling.
We left Philadelphia Thursday evening. We flew from the international terminal at PHL on USAirways. We were originally supposed to fly from A6 at one end of the terminal, and shortly after we settled down there, an announcement came over the PA that there was a gate change and we needed to switch to A23 at the other end of the terminal.</description>

      <description>Or &amp;#8220;How to proofread a job posting&amp;#8221;.
I came across this posting on the python group I&amp;#8217;m a member of on (in?) Linked In.
The first typo, was a bit awkward, but I could see how it would happen during an editing/revision session when that session wasn&amp;#8217;t followed by a proofreading. &amp;#8220;Our client is a leader in the worldwide leader&amp;#8221;. So, what you&amp;#8217;re saying is they lead?
But what actually cracked me up was the simple substitution of a &amp;#8220;t&amp;#8221; where a &amp;#8220;d&amp;#8221; should go.</description>

      <description>About 20 years ago, my grandfather &amp;#8220;(Grand) Pop&amp;#8221; died. I still remember packing up his model trains with my dad and some of the rest of the family. The specific bit of his legacy for me. They hadn&amp;#8217;t been unpacked since. Instead, they followed me from place to place still in the boxes we packed back then. For the past several years, they were stored with the inlaws who recently kindly suggested that maybe it was time for them to come home.</description>

      <description>I started a new job last week. I&amp;#8217;m the VP Operations for Perrone Robotics. There are many things that I&amp;#8217;m responsible for. Internal IT and Network Infrastructure, Quality Assurance, Release Management and Customer Deployments. It&amp;#8217;s a handful, and like any good job, understaffed. But it&amp;#8217;s going to be fun. And I&amp;#8217;m going to learn lots. I&amp;#8217;m quite excited by the undertaking. Not to mention, it means we get to stay in Charlottesville a bit longer 🙂</description>

      <description>Today ls &amp;#8220;black Friday.&amp;#8221; There are a lot of people out shopping today. I&amp;#8217;m not one of them.
However, I&amp;#8217;m also not part of some ideological movement in opposition to shopping today. I just don&amp;#8217;t like crowds. I can&amp;#8217;t be bothered.
I was invited to a &amp;#8220;buy nothing&amp;#8221; day on Facebook. I suppose if the point is to raise awareness of needless consumerism, I&amp;#8217;m a fan. But in this era of anti-capitalism, of the &amp;#8220;99%&amp;#8221;, I&amp;#8217;m wary.</description>

      <description>My mood has been low recently. But it&amp;#8217;s been lifted this morning by song.

I&amp;#8217;m listening to my &amp;#8220;Everything but the Girl&amp;#8221; radio station on Pandora. As Carolyn put it, &amp;#8220;Is it nothing but Everything But the Girl&amp;#8221;? Pleasant enough in itself, but thanks to Lexus, I&amp;#8217;m enjoying it as part of a free trial to Pandora One. It&amp;#8217;s funny how it&amp;#8217;s the little things. For no particular reason that I can think of, BMW has always been the target of my automotive lust.</description>

      <title>Steam Cracked</title>
      <link>https://blog.accapehart.com/2011/11/steam-cracked/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Nov 2011 04:26:16 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>choicywhiteboy@accapehart.com (AC Capehart)</author>
      <guid>https://blog.accapehart.com/2011/11/steam-cracked/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got a disturbing message on my Steam account, today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;intruders obtained access to a Steam database in addition to the forums. &lt;strong&gt;This database contained information including user names, hashed and salted passwords, game purchases, email addresses, billing addresses and encrypted credit card information&lt;/strong&gt;. We do not have evidence that encrypted credit card numbers or personally identifying information were taken by the intruders, or that the protection on credit card numbers or passwords was cracked. We are still investigating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(emphasis mine)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m unimpressed. Credit card data was in the same database as user data, purchase history, billing address, etc? To me, that means either: 1)They kept a whole bunch of information in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/&#34;&gt;PCI-DSS&lt;/a&gt; secured vault at great expense as getting data into and out of such a vault is difficult by design, or 2) They were storing credit card data outside of a PCI-DSS vault in direct violation of the guidelines set forth by Visa, MasterCard, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m also disturbed by the cagey language. &amp;#8220;We do not have evidence that &amp;#8230; credit card numbers &amp;#8230; were taken by the intruders.&amp;#8221; Given that it apparently took them 4 days from the forum defacement until the general announcement, I&amp;#8217;m insufficiently impressed with their reported forensics to think that their lack of evidence for some activity means an absence of that activity. Who knows how long they were in breach even before the forum defacement that caused them to stumble over the broader breach? I&amp;#8217;m also curious what algorithm was used for the credit card encryption. And where was the encryption key kept? Was it potentially exposed as well?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I&amp;#8217;m also sympathetic. When I was with Linden Lab, we suffered a database breach as well. We ended up forcing a change to everyone&amp;#8217;s passwords, pulling an all-nighter to implement new password recovery measures, manning the telephones to personally talk with affected customers and help them validate their accounts and change their passwords. Credit card data, however, was never exposed, nor at risk at the level of penetration the attacker reached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, I had a conversation with Valve nearly a year ago. I&amp;#8217;d heard they were looking for some international payment expertise and I got in touch. They ended up not thinking that I was what they needed, but at least I was able to put them in touch with the great people at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.envoyservices.com/&#34;&gt;Envoy&lt;/a&gt;. They apparently didn&amp;#8217;t connect either. I wish they&amp;#8217;d gotten someone in though, and that someone had taken a good, hard look at their credit card processing and storage. They&amp;#8217;d have been able to write a much less embarrassing letter. The full text of the note follows the break, but it ends with &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;I am truly sorry this happened, and I apologize for the inconvenience.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; I believe they&amp;#8217;re sorry it happened, but this is still such a milk toast apology. If I had to write that letter it would say something a little stronger, something like: &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#8217;m deeply disappointed that we failed to maintain the trust you put in us when you shared your personal information with us, and we&amp;#8217;re going to do everything we can to redouble our security efforts to ensure this sort of thing never happens again and to earn back your trust and loyalty as our most valued resource &amp;#8211; our customer.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meanwhile, if you have a Steam account, do yourself a favor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change your Steam password&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change your password anywhere else you used the Steam password (you know you did)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove your payment information from Steam until they can demonstrate they can be trusted with it
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Steam Users and Steam Forum Users:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>On the invitation of Sam&amp;#8217;s soccer football coach from West City Soccer with whom we play &amp;#8220;Family Futbol&amp;#8221;, I have joined a Co-Rec soccer league with SOCA. If I&amp;#8217;m not the oldest player on the team, I&amp;#8217;m pretty close. This team has a reserved field on Wednesdays for practice. We had our first practice last week, and there were maybe 6 or so team members who came out to practice. We did a little bit of practice on corner kicks, but it pretty quickly devolved into a small pick-up game.</description>

      <description>I had heard that Comcast&amp;#8217;s introduction into the area of some greater DOCSIS 3 infrastructure might have a positive impact on my available bandwidth. Sure enough, I&amp;#8217;m approaching 30 Mbs. Of course upload speeds aren&amp;#8217;t what they were last time I checked, but maybe that&amp;#8217;s a &amp;#8220;time of test&amp;#8221; issue.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;#8217;t believe it&amp;#8217;s been nearly a quarter since my last update. Certainly, I&amp;#8217;ve been keeping pretty busy. Singing Horse Studio is doing well, and starting to get as much work as we can handle. We now need to work on managing our growth. Another tricky area for a young business &amp;mdash; actually for ANY business. We&amp;#8217;ve expanded into the USA having successfully registered with the Virginia State Corporation Comission on July 1st, 2011.</description>

      <description>I had gone to do a little play dev work and discovered that my AWS machine was on a version of Ubuntu for which support had long-ago ended. I&amp;#8217;m setting up a new AWS host, but it&amp;#8217;s taking a little while to get everything sorted back out. So if my sites seem &amp;#8220;a bit off&amp;#8221; for the next couple of days, that&amp;#8217;s probably why. Like for some reason, the permalink structure of my wordpress instance doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to be working.</description>

      <description>I have two really smart friends who are building MailRank. I don&amp;#8217;t know more than they&amp;#8217;ve posted online or made inferences from their name, but I think they are trying to make email distinguish between the stuff you do care about (mail from your spouse) and stuff that&amp;#8217;s not spam, but you don&amp;#8217;t care about (mail from the bike shop, mail from your mom). If it works (and, to be sure, I&amp;#8217;ve got no idea how it possibly could), I&amp;#8217;d love to get a &amp;#8220;biff&amp;#8221; style notification of &amp;#8220;mail I do care about&amp;#8221;!</description>

      <description>I do some of my best thinking in the shower. Or at least it feels like it while I&amp;#8217;m in the shower. 🙂 But, if ever there were a guilty pleasure of mine, it&amp;#8217;s a long, hot shower. Both the water required and the power required to heat that water are a wasteful luxury. As I was musing this over in the shower this morning, it occurred to me that most of this waste is because the water going down the drain that is still &amp;#8220;mostly hot&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;mostly clean.</description>

      <description>This morning, I had a simple, but I think profound realization. Wealth creation is not a zero-sum game. For me to be wealthier, I do not need to make you poorer. Now, I&amp;#8217;ve known this before. You probably have too. But sometimes it feels like it, because of the exchange of money, and the erroneous conflation of money with wealth.
Wealth has been in the back of my mind for some time.</description>

      <description>I like Virgin Airlines. I particularly liked my transcontinental business class trip on Virgin America. I like the Virgin lounge in Heathrow. And I LOVE business class when east-bound transatlantic. I&amp;#8217;ve had worse nights of sleep in hotels than on that &amp;#8220;red eye&amp;#8221; (I&amp;#8217;m looking at you Barcelona Pensione!) Obviously, I&amp;#8217;m a Virgin flying club member.
That was then. This is now.
Now, each transatlantic flight comes directly out of my own pocket and I&amp;#8217;m in uncertain financial waters as I try to start a transatlantic business.</description>

      <description>After much humming and hawing, I signed up for broadband in Virginia with Comcast. I&amp;#8217;m wary of them based on their filtering, and other subscribers talking about their dropping idle connections (sometimes, long-lived SSH connections are handy). But I wasn&amp;#8217;t able to get much bandwidth from CenturyLink due to my location. So far, speedtest looks downright awesome. Here are the results from my new connection in Virginia.
Here&amp;#8217;s what I get at the inlaws office where I&amp;#8217;m working now.</description>

      <description>I had a dream last night about a statue. That&amp;#8217;s all I remember about the dream &amp;#8211; the statue. The statue was titled &amp;#8220;The Many Muses of Flight&amp;#8221;
It was all white as if carved from white marble. It had a man in Dickensian garb complete with top hat leaping up, but he was only partially distinct from the white marble mass which was primarily shaped like the plumes of smoke from the early stages of a rocket launch.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was thinking recently of things I&amp;#8217;ve done, places I&amp;#8217;ve been. At forty, I still feel young. New to the world, even though my body isn&amp;#8217;t capable of what it once was. Looking back though, I&amp;#8217;m astonished and overwhelmed at the people and events that have found their way into my lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes at Thanksgiving, the holiday has just come and gone. Good food, good friends and family. This year, though I spent a little bit of time reflecting. I count myself genuinely lucky for the breadth of experiences I&amp;#8217;ve had, people I&amp;#8217;ve known, places I&amp;#8217;ve been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>If you can&amp;#8217;t say anything nice, don&amp;#8217;t say anything at all.
 I don&amp;#8217;t recall if that was formally part of my upbringing, but for the most part, I take it to heart. I&amp;#8217;ve been pretty quiet lately.
In part, it seems to be the norm for social media too. It&amp;#8217;s OK to be momentarily frustrated by something, or to need help with a task, but if it&amp;#8217;s not funny, engaging, or a bit of over-sharing, it doesn&amp;#8217;t belong in your tweet or your facebook update.</description>

      <description>Saturday: Ditchling Beacon to Devil&amp;#8217;s Dyke (route) (photos)
Sunday: Lewes Castle to Brighton (route) (photos)
Originally, this weekend, we had planned to train up to Gatwick and from there to take a trail along to Pooh Corner and the Hundred acre woods. We had that queued up for Sunday so decided to go for a walk on Saturday. Only we slept in on Sunday because Saturday&amp;#8217;s walk tired us out, so we gave up Pooh Corner in favor of Lewes Castle.</description>

      <description>The route with
Simon   &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Two weekends ago, I went out with Simon and we tooled around in the woods and on bridle trails (usually!) for 20-odd miles. My rides with Simon have been a delight, if not exactly purposeful. Like any riding, it&amp;amp;#8217;s only a matter of making the time for &amp;amp;#8217;em. Cycling remains for me the one form of exercise that I don&amp;amp;#8217;t think of as exercise, but as fun.</description>

      <description>I just upgraded to the latest version of WordPress. I also deleted a lot of users. If one of them was you and your actually reading this, sorry. Best I could tell it was sleeper spam accounts. But basically, if your email address is in the .ru or .pl domains, and your &amp;#8220;real name&amp;#8221; doesn&amp;#8217;t match your email address at all, I figured you and I weren&amp;#8217;t on very close terms.</description>

      <description>On Friday, it was supposed to rain. We were going to go shopping. I needed a replacement keychain &amp;#8211; my &amp;#8220;England&amp;#8221; one from Heathrow had broken under the strain of daily use. I needed a hat (CF my post wherein I left my hat on the train on the way up). I was interested in a sweater of Scottish wool. We have various birthdays coming up that we need to provide for.</description>

      <description>Thursday, we again had an excellent lie in, and a lazy breakfast in the cottage wherein we discussed what we might want to do. There were three hikes that I had in mind as possibilities. 1) The mountain we&amp;#8217;d skirted around on our Killiecrankie walk, 2) the loop near the top of the mountain we&amp;#8217;d traversed on our Strathtay walk or 3) further up the Tummel river to see &amp;#8220;Queen&amp;#8217;s View&amp;#8220;.</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;re back from another very nice, if somewhat wearying hike. This time, we walked &amp;#8220;over the hill&amp;#8221; from Pitlochry to Strathtay. The hike was nice, though
View back
over Pitlochry  today, the boots weren&amp;#8217;t as magic, and Botticelli, while still engaging wasn&amp;#8217;t as thoroughly distracting as it was the day before. Therefore, we had a somewhat more recalcitrant hiker than a couple of days ago. Still, all things considered, I&amp;#8217;m pleased with her capability and willingness.</description>

      <description>A relaxed day in and near town. The morning consisted of some errands (buy postcards, scan documents for closing, buy a couple presents, some groceries, drop clothing off at the launderette). Lunch was sandwiches from the Scottish Deli. After lunch, we hiked through the Black Spout wood to reach the smallest distillery in Scotland &amp;#8211; Edradour.
We watched a video, took a tour and bought some gift-Scotch and some personal Scotch.</description>

      <description>Today, we hiked.
By the weather forecast, this looked to be the best day of the week, and as we were fresh, and came here to walk around, we set out for a hike.
We got off to a leisurely start. We had breakfast in our cottage, got ourselves packed up and headed off (after a quick trip to the Indian restaurant where we&amp;#8217;d eaten the night before to pick up the rucksack we&amp;#8217;d left there by accident!</description>

      <description>I can&amp;#8217;t count how many times I have looked on the back of a photograph hoping the photographer wrote down who those people are, or when or where the photo was taken. Well, it would actually be a fairly small number, but boy is it annoying when you want the data and it just isn&amp;#8217;t there. Digital cameras will almost always automatically embed date information for you (and if not, then the software you pick them up with will!</description>

      <description>OK, It&amp;#8217;s not day 1 anymore, but it feels that way.
Train  Saturday we took a train to London&amp;#8217;s Victoria station. Then we took a tube from there to King&amp;#8217;s Cross station. From there, we took a train to Edinburgh. From there, we took another train to Pitlochry. On the long-haul train from London to Edinburgh, we were fortunate in that we had reserved seats at a table and the reserved seats across from us were unoccupied, as we only needed 2 tickets, because Sam is an &amp;#8220;under 5&amp;#8221; but that meant we only got 2 seats.</description>

I&amp;#8217;ve been meaning to do this for a while. Capture some stories that I like on audio. This one&amp;#8217;s pretty good for a quick pass. I look forward to improving both production quality and reading. But it&amp;#8217;s fun to have read one of my favorite poems and captured it for later and maybe too, for others.</description>

      <description>Here is an interesting article. It feels like it might be subject to some (selection?) bias, but the outcome appeals to my sensibility. Key sentiment is below:
 My research revealed that lucky people generate good fortune via four basic principles. They are skilled at creating and noticing chance opportunities, make lucky decisions by listening to their intuition, create self-fulfilling prophesies via positive expectations, and adopt a resilient attitude that transforms bad luck into good.</description>

      <description>As we&amp;#8217;re getting ready to leave this place, I&amp;#8217;m occasionally hit by waves of nostalgia. I had a moment tonight as I looked out over the landscape from our front stoop. Off and on while we were in this house, Sam and I would get to spend some time together just before we started the night time ritual where we&amp;#8217;d &amp;#8220;look at the darkness&amp;#8221;. And we&amp;#8217;d been doing it off-and-on even from the point of her early language development so it evolved from &amp;#8220;I look ah dark?</description>

Here&amp;#8217;s what&amp;#8217;s on offer:
1994 Toyota 4-Runner SRV 6-cylinder, 5 speed manual transmission with in-console 4-wheel drive (You don&amp;#8217;t have to get out of the car to put it in 4-wheel drive.</description>

And we&amp;#8217;ll have a couple of MacBook Pros connecting either wired or wirelessly. In the meanwhile, we&amp;#8217;ve got a few other devices on the net including a printer, the old audiotron, etc.</description>

The s&amp;amp;#8217;mores fire next to me radiating dwindling heat and light. The redwoods arcing overhead painting inky shadows against the sky lit with the glow of stars and the city both close and far. I&amp;amp;#8217;m glad to be sharing it with Sam who I hear tossing and turning in the tent, sleepless from the novelty.</description>

      <description>As a youth, living with my dad, we changed the oil together on the 1973 VW Beetle that became mine when I turned 16. So, it wasn&amp;#8217;t an unfamiliar concept. But I was long out of practice. Nonetheless, it was past due on my motorcycle and while I could just take it to the mechanic, I don&amp;#8217;t have a mechanic here I&amp;#8217;m totally in love with. So, with some encouragement from a friend, I decided to undertake it myself.</description>

The Poem   &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; I came home after work one day recently, and at some point in the evening, out of the blue, Sam says: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; &amp;amp;#8220;I wrote you a poem daddy.

      <description>I went for a bit of a meander-y bike ride today. For a good bit of it, I was on San Pablo Ave (see map below.)
San Pablo Ave is 4 lanes of automotive traffic, and has occasional bike lanes. At one point I was honked at, presumably for not being &amp;#8220;in my place&amp;#8221; in the bike lane. I&amp;#8217;m not sure I was flipped off, but I sure was startled so just in case, I [I went for a bit of a meander-y bike ride today.</description>

      <description>Had a nice, if somewhat hot, day out motorcycling with Frank, formerly of Linden Lab, now of Aquarium of the Bay. Wandered the far east bay. Wound up again at Port Costa. Had drinks and a sandwich there. Watched trains and tankers and tugs. Talked. Thought. Threw rocks into the Carquinez Straight. Came back through Crockett (whence came &amp;#8220;The Rocket From Crockett&amp;#8220;) and got home around 6 PM.
The last leg was really interesting from a meteorological perspective.</description>

      <description>I woke from a weird dream this morning. A new colleague (who doesn&amp;#8217;t really exist) was objecting to some work that I wanted to do that would leverage the cloud and improve the user experience because it would &amp;#8220;cause more workload.&amp;#8221; Some time later, we&amp;#8217;re at a webdev meeting and I realize I&amp;#8217;m the supervisor of all these people and the team is so large it&amp;#8217;s unwieldy. Someone higher up in the organization is talking to us about something that&amp;#8217;s not particularly engaging.</description>

      <description>I tweeted that I was going to drag myself outside today, and probably be glad I did. I did, and I was. I decided to go for a wander on my street bicycle. I&amp;#8217;d not gotten more than a couple hundred yards when I had a little trouble shifting, so I immediately turned around to diagnose with tools at home. I eventually decided that the support for Sam&amp;#8217;s sidecar was pinching the shifter cable.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;#8217;t really think of myself as an adrenaline junkie, but the way I&amp;#8217;m beaming at the moment may be betraying me. I just got back from a mountain bike ride. It was amazing (or if you&amp;#8217;re reading this from the UK, it was brilliant. Or if you&amp;#8217;re reading this on teh inter webz, it was teh awesome)!
The girls are away, there are trails nearby that I&amp;#8217;ve only begun to explore, I had no plans for the day, and because it&amp;#8217;s California, the weather was simply perfect.</description>

This morning, we were talking about the day and she said she was going to go as a fairy. Because it&amp;#8217;s fairy land. Mom asked what Mom and Dad should go as.</description>

I was ambivalent about going originally as it seemed like it would be a bit of a hassle to get there. Originally, it was going to be only Sam and myself going, but as Carolyn helped us figure out how best to get there, she decided it looked interesting to her too, so we decided to all go.</description>

I&amp;#8217;m going to date-adjust the post back in time to when I actually wrote it instead of when I finally got back to the states and therefore around to publishing it.
Today, I turn 39. It&amp;#8217;s feeling kinda old.</description>

      <description>Sam got her first &amp;#8220;bicycle&amp;#8221; today. We got her a &amp;#8220;balance bike&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;walking bike&amp;#8221;. We&amp;#8217;d looked around and found some pretty good deals on amazon, but we wanted to try it out in the shop before making a purchase like that. So we went to a few different bike shops including Performance that didn&amp;#8217;t have any. We wound up at &amp;#8220;Mike&amp;#8217;s Bikes&amp;#8221; where they had a few from Specialized. Sam was really cute as she skuut&amp;#8217;ed around the store on it, making &amp;#8220;ch&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;ch&amp;#8221; sounds.</description>

      <description>Something has happened at work that has caused me a certain amount of anxiety. In response to that, I decided I really needed a pet project. I still don&amp;#8217;t know what that project was going to be, but there were a few technologies that I thought I&amp;#8217;d like to know better / play with. Specifically, Twisted, Stackless and RabbitMQ.
I got on to the ubuntu box that I host in the amazon cloud and started doing updates so that I had a current box to do some of the above installs on.</description>

She didn&amp;#8217;t know that that&amp;#8217;s where her (great-)aunt Janet is from, so we talked about that. She asked where her (great-)aunt Scotties is from, and I said &amp;#8220;Richmond, where Grand-mÃ¨re lives now.&amp;#8221; The following conversation ensued:
 Sam: Daddy, I&amp;#8217;ve got a new country coming.
Dad: Oh? What&amp;#8217;s the name of the new country?</description>

We have about a 15 (adult) minute walk from the flat to the Brighton train station. From there, it&amp;#8217;s a little under an hour to London, St. Pancras. From there, a little under three hours to Paris Gare de Nord. From there, 15 min on the Paris Metro and 5 minutes to the flat.</description>

I was amused by the following juxtaposition:
 &amp;#8230;there will be greater access to government, with online services to let anyone question members of the president&amp;#8217;s Cabinet or track every dime of the federal budget.
 &amp;#8230;

      <description>No, not diabolical lesbians, but instead a valley (and surrounding hillside) that&amp;#8217;s part of the South Downs in Sussex, not far north of Brighton and Hove. Now maintained by the National Trust. Carolyn, Sam and I had an outing there after a late Sunday breakfast. We hiked around, had a picnic lunch, and I got some kite flying in. I was worried that I was going to have packed my kite for nothing, but already I&amp;#8217;ve flown both days this weekend.</description>

      <description>There are people in my life who, when they keep re-appearing, cause me to ask myself why. I can only assume it&amp;#8217;s because they have a lesson to teach me and I&amp;#8217;ve not learned it yet. I have to assume it&amp;#8217;s something about communication style with this individual. As Carolyn put it, &amp;#8220;Some geeks are cute. Their social awkwardness leading to a shyness that can be endearing. Others are just off-putting.</description>

I&amp;#8217;ve been using growth as a proxy for life when Sam asks &amp;#8220;Why aren&amp;#8217;t cars alive?&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Are trucks alive?&amp;#8221;

Mom just read Sam a draft of another children&amp;#8217;s story, and now Sam is &amp;#8220;writing&amp;#8221; and telling stories. The most recent one is something about how when Mommy was a little girl and Sam was a bigger girl and there was a fox in the woods and we made it to the top of big rock candy mountain. (She&amp;#8217;s also been listening to the soundtrack of &amp;#8220;O Brother, Where Art Thou?</description>

 Mommy, I have to do some work today {pause} on the computer.
 No doubt b/c of yesterday. She threw a mini-fit at dinner time because it was time to wash hands instead of continuing to play with alphababy.</description>

      <description>Well, OK, she didn&amp;#8217;t write her name by herself today. This morning, we practiced together with pen and paper. I tried to get her to hold the pen &amp;#8220;properly&amp;#8221; but didn&amp;#8217;t get far with that. Her &amp;#8216;S&amp;#8217; looked like something between a &amp;#8220;d&amp;#8221; and a squared-off &amp;#8220;o&amp;#8221;. But later in the afternoon, I set her down in front of AlphaBaby, and I pointed out some of the letters, drew her name with stars, etc.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Iâ€™m writing this to you on my 38th birthday. This morning when I got you up out of your crib, you asked, â€œWhat day is today?â€ I replied, â€œMonday.â€ Then you said, â€œItâ€™s Mommyâ€™s birthday! Happy Birthday, Mommy!â€ And you gave me a hug.
Best. Birthday. Present. Ever.
A few hours later, we were running errands on foot and you wanted me to carry you, and I was already lugging two bags of groceries, and you wouldnâ€™t wear your sun hat, and you kept telling me to take mine off, and you cried and complained for the last two blocks.</description>

      <description>Dear Sammy,
For your newsletter describing your 30th month of life, Iâ€™ve been collecting phrases that weâ€™ve heard around the house. These are the ones that make your Dad and me grin, or gasp, or sometimes grimace. But in each case, we look at each other and mouth â€œdid she just say that?â€
Here you go. Soundbites from a 2Â½ year-old girl:
â€œMommies donâ€™t go to work. Daddies do.â€
â€œIâ€™m not a big girl yet.</description>

      <description>As a preface to this post, it&amp;#8217;s important to understand that Sam still doesn&amp;#8217;t enunciate very clearly. She can&amp;#8217;t properly create all the phonemes in the English language. Sam&amp;#8217;s babysitter was impressed with how much Sam talked, but bemoaned how little she could understand of what Sam was saying. We&amp;#8217;re pretty good at making it out. After all, we&amp;#8217;ve been listening to her since she was born! Anyway, words like &amp;#8220;Turtle&amp;#8221; don&amp;#8217;t yet sound like &amp;#8220;turtle&amp;#8221; It&amp;#8217;s more like &amp;#8220;tor lul&amp;#8221;.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
I&amp;#8217;m not sure where to start for this month. I suppose all months are continuations of the previous, but that seems especially true this month. Probably because it took me getting half way through this month before finally abdicating last month&amp;#8217;s newsletter to your mother. Regardless, this month was full of growth and change for you. Mom indicates that you&amp;#8217;ve been &amp;#8220;speaking in paragraphs&amp;#8221; for some time now. I&amp;#8217;m not really sure how or when that happened, but you do string together related sentences.</description>

      <description>Dear Sammy,
Dad and I are a few weeks late with this newsletter. You (and the people we share this letter with) will have to forgive us: your 28th month was a difficult oneâ€”not because of you, but because this past month saw the death of a longtime family member: our beloved kitty Camus.
Iâ€™m going to start there. He died near the end of the month, but his death has colored the entire month.</description>

      <description>My wife already blogged the Salsa Cat story. But I&amp;#8217;ve been amazed at Sam&amp;#8217;s story-re-telling ability. She&amp;#8217;ll &amp;#8220;read&amp;#8221; books almost word for word that we&amp;#8217;ve read to her. Sure, we&amp;#8217;ve read them a lot, but not enough for us to be able to recite them. Anyway, here Sam is re-telling the Salsa Cat story.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s funny to me how apt a name Camus was for our cat. While perhaps only in stereotype was our cat an absurdest existentialist cat. He hardly qualified as warm and friendly. Really, if you imagine a cat named Camus, you&amp;#8217;d probably be pretty spot-on.
But he wasn&amp;#8217;t always called Camus. When I first met him, his name was &amp;#8220;Match.&amp;#8221; I don&amp;#8217;t know what, exactly, inspired me to give Carolyn a cat for her birthday in 1995.</description>

      <description>We euthanized our cat, Camus, today. It seems such a strange way to say it. But easier than &amp;#8220;we took a family member to be killed today.&amp;#8221;
Camus resting  I guess it had been coming for a while. A long while, really. He&amp;#8217;d had feline mega colon for years. Mostly we&amp;#8217;d managed it medically, giving him 4 different medications ((cisapride, lactulose, mineral oil and metamucil)) twice daily. Still, cleaning up errant poop or vomit wasn&amp;#8217;t an uncommon occurrence.</description>

      <description>I suppose it shouldn&amp;#8217;t come as a surprise that a reporter would have a blog. Nor that &amp;#8220;Santa Al&amp;#8221; would make a blog-worthy impression. Still, it&amp;#8217;s a bit of a trip to run across. OK, I didn&amp;#8217;t really &amp;#8220;run across&amp;#8221; it &amp;#8212; he forwarded it to me. But there you go. A reporter got caught up in my dad&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;alternate reality&amp;#8221; field. Maybe that&amp;#8217;s why I&amp;#8217;ve been into virtual worlds for so long; I&amp;#8217;m just trying to recreate my childhood.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Well, Chrissum time is over. Alas, by the end you were saying &amp;#8220;Christmas&amp;#8221; about as often as you said Crissum. Your little approximations of words are cute and fleeting. Already I miss getting to hear the babble of your baby talk and wish I&amp;#8217;d found a way to record more of it. This month has begun a real inquisitive phase for you. You have a hard time being adjacent to a conversation without saying something like &amp;#8220;What&amp;#8217;s mommy and daddy talking about?</description>

Dad: He sat in your car seat?
Sam: No, I sat in my car seat. He sat next to me. And a birdie sat next to me.
Dad: Isn&amp;#8217;t a blue jay a type of bird?
Sam: And the blue jay said &amp;#8220;Wow.&amp;#8221;
Dad: Wow?
Sam: &amp;#8220;WOW! [pause] There&amp;#8217;s some trees out there!</description>

      <description>I was trying to get Sam down for her nap today. She was tired enough, but is still a bit cranky as she attempts to get over a tummy bug. I asked which pajamas she wanted, and she had decided &amp;#8220;polka dots&amp;#8221; (which have feet in them.) So, to put those on we took her socks off. She decided she wanted to keep her socks on so asked for &amp;#8220;monkies&amp;#8221; which don&amp;#8217;t have feet.</description>

      <description>&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s Crissum Time!&amp;#8221; Dear Sam,
Before you came into our lives, I knew, and almost certainly used, the phrase &amp;#8220;childlike delight,&amp;#8221; but I really don&amp;#8217;t think I had the visceral sense of the meaning of that phrase until you showed up to demonstrate it for me. You love looking at people&amp;#8217;s Christmas lights (Crissum lights) &amp;#8212; including our own. You&amp;#8217;ve even interrupted whatever play was going on at the time to simply call out, in case anyone forgot, that &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s Crissum time!</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
When I put you down for your afternoon nap just now, you sang along to your bedtime song â€œSamantha, fais dodo.â€ I was trying not to smile too hard, because, you knowâ€¦ itâ€™s nap time and you have a hard enough time as it is settling down to rest. When we finished the song, you exclaimed â€œSammy did it!â€ After I left the room, you reprised the song, and then added a few rounds of â€œFrÃ¨re Jacques,â€ followed by a rousing rendition of â€œPop Goes the Weasel.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Well, it&amp;#8217;s not quite month 25 yet, but this is certainly the latest I&amp;#8217;ve been for a while. It&amp;#8217;s going to be hard not to talk about where you are now, but to restrict it to where you were then. Even though then and now are only a few weeks apart!
I guess let&amp;#8217;s start with linguistic development. Impressive as usual. You have a large nursery rhyme book that you enjoy.</description>

      <description>This link made the rounds at work today. I shared it with bk and Carolyn, my only (semi-)regular non-Linden workday correspondents, and Carolyn suggested I blog it. I won&amp;#8217;t steal the thunder from the article to recreate it here, but it&amp;#8217;s a short read and reasonably insightful if perhaps a little over-broad. It&amp;#8217;s about the &amp;#8220;tact filter&amp;#8221; and its orientation between nerds and &amp;#8220;normal&amp;#8221; people. [[In an age where people have &amp;#8216;(re)claimed&amp;#8217; geekness to the point where &amp;#8216;athletics geek&amp;#8217; is no longer a completely laughable oxymoron, is there such a thing as a &amp;#8216;normal&amp;#8217; person?</description>

      <description>I guess this really has been a bay area weekend. Yesterday, we went down to Berkeley partly just to wander, partly to pick up a kid-sized table and chairs for Sam that Carolyn arranged to buy through BPN but partly to go to Half Price Books. We were seeking the third book in the Song of Fire and Ice series &amp;#8212; A Storm of Swords. I gave up on the series after the first book &amp;#8212; too much soap opera, too little fantasy, but it engulfed Carolyn like a raging storm (of swords?</description>

      <description>The past 3 weekends have all been wet in some way or another. I went sailing on the bay on a 30&amp;#8242; Hunter a few weeks ago. Last weekend, we went to a beach that&amp;#8217;s a 10-or-so minute drive pretty much due west of our house, and this weekend we went to the 36th annual NCMA boat show. It was great except that we got a late start so that we didn&amp;#8217;t get much time there before we had to come back for nap time.</description>

      <description>Last weekend, we were dining at our favorite local Thai restaurant and we had a seating neighbor who was fairly loud. Since we&amp;#8217;re north of Berkeley (and in the San Francisco area), the fact that she was &amp;#8220;naturally&amp;#8221; dressed and appeared to be on a date with her female companion went completely without note. That she was on an easily overheard and extended rant about her neighbor&amp;#8217;s behavior was a little bit annoying.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
It&amp;#8217;s been a quarter of a year since I last wrote your newsletter! Thank goodness Mom stepped up to the plate. She also saved my butt this month as I have a &amp;#8220;notes&amp;#8221; email from her containing what could be considered &amp;#8220;talking points&amp;#8221; for this newsletter. Two thing really stand out for me in particular this month though:
1) Jumping and Skipping. You really enjoy both of them. You also enjoy requesting them of me.</description>

      <description>People have complained (or admired) Apple computer for its effective product launches and getting a great deal of excitement about upcoming or just released products. This has not escaped the watchful eye of the onion. Probably a quarter of the people in my office already have the iPhone.
And yet truth is at least as strange as fiction as I saw this teaser at the top of another commuter&amp;#8217;s paper today: &amp;#8220;Apple ready to announce what&amp;#8217;s next.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure there&amp;#8217;s a name for this &amp;#8212; the discord between the name of something being an inaccurate description. You know several government examples like &amp;#8220;The clean air act&amp;#8221; or the &amp;#8220;defense department&amp;#8221;. Yesterday morning on my commute, I had a moment of disconnect until I realized that distinction again. I saw a van a lane or two over with a picture of the Golden Gate Bridge on it, and in big letters, &amp;#8220;Bridge Painters.</description>

      <description>I am a couple of months behind in reading Wired, and just came across Clive Thomson&amp;#8217;s article on Twitter. Anyone who follows me (OK, just Yoz) knows how infrequently I update.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#8217;s about like this blog.&amp;nbsp; There are two bits of it that struck a chord with me:
 Productivity guru Tim Ferriss calls Twitter &amp;#8220;pointless email on steroids.&amp;#8221;
 I had a very similar reaction to it when I first stumbled across it.</description>

      <description>Well, as you can see from the sidebar change, I added &amp;#8220;Now Reading&amp;#8221; rather than writing my own. That&amp;#8217;s OK. I&amp;#8217;ll find something else to geek out on soon enough. I&amp;#8217;m wondering if I should generalize it to &amp;#8220;Now Consuming&amp;#8221; and add DVD&amp;#8217;s we&amp;#8217;re watching and games I&amp;#8217;m playing.</description>

      <description>I wrote a long and detailed trip report on my recent SIGGRAPH trip for work.&amp;nbsp; I was figuring to simply copy-paste it here, but in review, it seems a little too Linden-centric, so over the next couple of days I&amp;#8217;ll try to figure out how best to excerpt it/restructure it to bring it out here.&amp;nbsp; I was embarrassed that Carolyn had (until just now) written my two most recent blog entries and even so they were a month apart.</description>

      <description>At SIGGRAPH, one of the area chiefs for the Guerilla Studio raved about Flock, so I thought I&amp;#8217;d try it out.&amp;nbsp; This is a post initiated from within Flock on the &amp;#8220;Post to my blog&amp;#8221; button.
Also, a little Sam update.&amp;nbsp; Today, she did two new slides by herself at the playground at Canyon Oak Trail.&amp;nbsp; One tall and twisty, the other shorter but steep and enclosed, aka &amp;#8220;the tunnel.&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp; Previously, she&amp;#8217;d refused to do this without holding someone&amp;#8217;s hand and since neither is at all conducive to hand-holding, she&amp;#8217;d simply not done either before.</description>

      <description>Dear Sammy,
Daddy was going to write your letter this month, but since a) heâ€™s sick, and b) heâ€™s working for SIGGRAPH at San Diego this week, and c) youâ€™re giving me a nice long nap this afternoon, I decided that I would start it.
So, hi Sammy! Happy 22 months old! Youâ€™re two months away from two years old. Technically. In practical terms, youâ€™re right smack dab in the middle of the Terrible Twoâ€™s.</description>

      <description>Dear Sammy,
I have a lot to tell you about this past month, but first let me tell you a little anecdote that has completely charmed your father and me. We still end your day with a reading of Time for Bed (by Mem Fox)â€”a little story book we received when you were born. Weâ€™ve been reading it to you since you were about 4 months old. Each page has a little rhyme about a parent animal telling the baby animal that itâ€™s time for sleep.</description>

      <description>OK, I just learned that there&amp;#8217;s now a facebook application called &amp;#8220;the love machine&amp;#8221; which is quite similar to the one we use at work &amp;#8212; except that it&amp;#8217;s out there for everyone to use!
Curiously, it was created by Ooga Labs who have our CEO as an advisor (on their board?). As our CTO has said, (paraphrasing) &amp;#8220;Now that facebook has announced their API/platform, never build another in-house social networking app&amp;#8221;.</description>

      <description>Sometimes, I can get into a groove with taking care of myself when my family&amp;#8217;s not around. I haven&amp;#8217;t found that groove yet. While I like the flexibility I get in timing, getting to go to &amp;#8220;Movie Nite&amp;#8221; with other Lindens, etc. I miss my family and look forward to getting them back. (They&amp;#8217;re at Mom-mom&amp;#8217;s house helping out while she gets a mitral valve repaired (!!!))
At least I get to talk to Sam on the phone pretty much every day.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m not exactly sure why my wife wanted me to take this quiz, much less post it. But she wanted both, so here it is. I&amp;#8217;d say that about the only thing interesting about it is that I grew up in the south, and both of my parents have stronger southern accents than I do. My mom is from the midwest though, and Durham is a rather cultured city at least compared to stereotypes of the south 🙂</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Wow. What a month. It is a real pleasure when your mom takes one of the monthly newsletters because it helps me recharge and get more energy and enthusiasm for writing. This month is a pleasure to write not just because of that break though. So much has happened in the past month, I barely know where to begin.
I guess I want to start with your verbal development, as despite everything else, that has what has impressed me so consistantly this month.</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;ve had a potty in the bathroom for a few weeks now. We give her praise for sitting on it, but mostly ignore it. We&amp;#8217;ve sat her on it in a way she could actually make use of it a few times before, but nothing&amp;#8217;s come of it. Today on the way to the bath (she traverses the house naked from the living room to the bathroom,) she asked for the potty and went to sit on it.</description>

      <description>We went to our second museum since Sam&amp;#8217;s birth today. And it was a much better experience than the previous time (in Princeton during Sam&amp;#8217;s first conference.) Sam lasted for a full 40 minutes or so at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA). They were having an exhibit of Picasso and American artists that he influenced. It was neat to see Picasso beside the artists the he inspired, whether direct derivations, or connected more tangentially.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
April has always been one of my favorite months, as it usually heralds the arrival of spring: longer, lighter days, breezy weather, delicate daffodils, and peeping baby frogs. Academics, however, like to quote T.S. Eliotâ€™s â€œThe Waste Landâ€ and proclaim that â€œApril is the cruelest month.â€ While it is true that the last month of the academic semester usually entails a mountain of grading, I always welcomed April gladly because it meant that the end of tedium and the beginning of May freedom was near.</description>

  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Well, I&amp;amp;#8217;d been hankering for some time. But tonight it became a reality. I purchased my 4th motorcycle. (No, I still don&amp;amp;#8217;t have the other three. I&amp;amp;#8217;ve only had one at a time, I&amp;amp;#8217;m no Jay Leno.) This one is just a little less crotch-rocket than I&amp;amp;#8217;d owned before. It still has zip, but it&amp;amp;#8217;s just a little more dignified, and a lot more comfortable. When I took it for an inaugural spin around the block, it was strikingly familiar.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Do you have anything in your life that you&amp;#8217;re (almost) always glad that you&amp;#8217;ve done, you usually enjoy doing, but you dislike (or just have a hard time) starting? I have several of these. Working out is one of them. I have a hard time getting from the house to the front door of the gym. Once I&amp;#8217;m through the doors, I usually enjoy myself, and when I&amp;#8217;m done a workout, I rarely regret having been.</description>

I was stopped on the walking portion of my morning commute today by an older Hispanic man and his obviously embarrassed wife. He told me, in fairly unaccented English: &amp;#8220;I am looking for the office of Miglatude.</description>

      <description>Sam, Carolyn and I went for an outing today after Sam&amp;#8217;s afternoon nap. We generally try to do these things in the morning when we have a little more time, but it was a typically lazy Sunday morning complete with lying around on the couch, listening to jazz and a pancake breakfast, so morning wasn&amp;#8217;t happening.

from the bridge   &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; It was a sunny afternoon here in El Cerrito, but we could see the fog nestled around the city with only the transamerica building and one other poking out.</description>

      <description>I have been remiss in my updates here. It&amp;#8217;s been a busy time at work, and to a certain extent at home. The work&amp;#8217;s not done, maybe I can talk about it once it has been. But there have been some big events of late. My mom&amp;#8217;s husband, Tom, died (see below.) After his death, and I hope for some recovery, she came out to visit spending about two weeks with us.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Some of the other moms that brings kids to your tot group remarked, &amp;#8220;Oooh, 17 months, that&amp;#8217;s a rough age.&amp;#8221; If that&amp;#8217;s the case, I can&amp;#8217;t wait to see a great age, because you&amp;#8217;ve been a real pleasure to be around this month. It&amp;#8217;s true that you&amp;#8217;re starting to explore this thing we call a tantrum, but the ones I&amp;#8217;ve been exposed to have been pretty managable, and we&amp;#8217;ve gotten you out of them without too much trouble.</description>

      <description>The radio was an important part of my childhood. I was limited in the amount of (non-PBS) television I was allowed to watch, but there was no such limit on the radio. The 80&amp;#8217;s contained the complete range of my teen-hood, and I still have a fondness for &amp;#8217;80&amp;#8217;s music. Mostly my parents listened to NPR (WUNC &amp;#8211; Chapel Hill), so that was a big part of my childhood too. I have fond memories (to the point of idealized nostalgia) of listening to &amp;#8220;Prairie Home Companion&amp;#8221; by kerosene lantern after Saturday evening meals nestled in the &amp;#8220;shack&amp;#8221; in the mountain woods of Virginia.</description>

      <description>I am reminded this weekend of why it is that we uprooted our lives and moved across the country.
For starters, weather. As I write this, it&amp;#8217;s 2-degrees F in Altoona. Here, it&amp;#8217;s 54-degrees F.
This weekend, we went to the Berkeley marina where we stumbled upon the Cal Sailing Club which I intend to join. Right there, there was also an adventure park which we did not yet explore and another playground where Sam stomped around in the sand, rode on the swings, and slid down the slide.</description>

      <description>Dear Samantha,
Tomorrow you will turn 16 months old. Back in Pennsylvania, a little groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil will stick his little brown nose out of his hole-in-the-dirt house and venture out into the air. Hundreds of people will watch to see if he sees his shadow. If he does, folklore has it that there will be six more weeks of winter. If not, there will be an early spring. I was saying to your Dad the other day that I doubt people in the San Francisco Bay area pay much attention to Groundhog Day.</description>

      <description>When I was a member of City Car Share, before my wife, daughter, furniture and car came out to join me in the bay area, I got to drive a Prius around. It was kinda cool. It could be erily quiet at stop lights, it got up to highway speed well enough, if occasionally hesitant. But one of the things that amused me most about it was a sticker on the window.</description>

      <description>I often (though no longer &amp;#8220;frequently&amp;#8221;) take &amp;#8220;casual carpool&amp;#8221; (or creepy carpool as my co-workers call it). This is an amazing thing to me as it feels like something that can only happen in the bay area. There are places around the east bay where people and automobiles congregate to get across the bay bridge. The advantage for pedestrians is a free ride across the bridge over into the city. The advantage for the driver is that they get to go around the toll plaza, and use the carpool lane.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Already it&amp;#8217;s been almost a month and a half, since I&amp;#8217;ve written your newsletter. Yet, in some ways it seems to me like I just wrote your month 14 newsletter. I&amp;#8217;ll be fascinated to see how both of us have a changing perception of time as we both mature. I remember as a child ((I was about to write &amp;#8216;kid&amp;#8217; here, but then remembered that as a kid, I wouldn&amp;#8217;t let anyone refer to me as &amp;#8216;kid&amp;#8217; because it (also) meant &amp;#8216;baby goat.</description>

      <description>Sam has really started taking off with the walking. Only a little bit of it is unsupported, but finger walking has come quite a long way in a short amount of time.
Last week, Mom and Sam came into the city so that Mom could get some new glasses. Sam and I had lunch in a park near the office. A passerby noted &amp;#8220;You two look like such a picture there.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
It&amp;#8217;s been a while since I (Dad) have written your monthly newsletter. I&amp;#8217;ve been fortunate that your mom has been willing to take up the challenge during the time that I was out in California without you guys, and during your transition out here. But I&amp;#8217;m back (and with a new interface on the blog) and do I get a great month to write about.

      <description>OK, it&amp;#8217;s not really her first steps, but today Sam walked unsupported for the first time in her life. Of course, I wasn&amp;#8217;t home for it. 🙁 But I did get to see a repeat performance later in the evening which I captured to share with you.
In other firsts today, Sam also cried when I left for work. She and mom stand at the picture window at the front of the house and wave as I go by (the path to the sidewalk is on the east side of the yard, and I head west on the sidewalk).</description>

      <description>It may come as a shock to some readers to know that my mom has re-married. I know it would have come as a shock to me had she not called me a few days before to let me know that they&amp;#8217;d decided to do it. That announcement was the shocker.
Both she and her beau (I mean husband) Tom enjoyed each other&amp;#8217;s company and they&amp;#8217;d been together for a while, but they had also both exclaimed their intent never to re-marry.</description>

      <description>In an effort to make it easy for friends and family this holiday season, I&amp;#8217;ve decided to purchase a Nintendo DS Lite. This might also help a little bit with my commute, but really, it&amp;#8217;s mainly out of consideration for others. That way anyone that wants to can find a convenient and not terribly expensive gift for me &amp;#8212; a game for the DS! I&amp;#8217;ve put a few on my amazon wishlist, but feel free to find other references and sources too if you&amp;#8217;re so moved.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,

Urban babies
wear black.  Today you turn 13 months old, which means we have completed the first month of your second year of life. This means that for the past month, weâ€™ve been saying things like â€œOh, remember this time last yearâ€¦?â€ This time last year you were too small for the Halloween costume we had for you (a black cat), we barely noticed the change back to Standard Time, I was still getting the hang of feeding you, and Daddy and I spent the better part of the days in pajamas.</description>

      <description>No, this is not about some new software from Valve. Instead today is momentous for a different kind of half life. It was Halloween in 1988 that Carolyn and I started dating. For those of you not doing the math, that was 18 years ago. For those of you continuing to not do the math, or that don&amp;#8217;t know us that well, we were 18 at the time.
Carolyn and I have been some form of romantic partners to each other for half our lives (at least at the year-granular level&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;m not going to write a script like my friend to do the to-the-minute calculation.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve spent a reasonable amount of time in each of Windows XP, Ubuntu and MacOS X for desktop computing, and I have all three available to me right now. But mostly, I find myself in the MacOS. Partly this is a machine issue &amp;#8212; the Intel box that dual boots XP/Ubuntu I built years ago and sounds like&amp;#8230; well like someone who wanted to put a lot of hardware in and so needed a lot of fans.</description>

Today in El Cerrito, CA was a high of 72 degrees F with a low of 49.</description>

We have a contract with a contingency that the buyer needs to sell his home, and we just learned that he had a contract. While I&amp;#8217;m terribly excited that soon we won&amp;#8217;t be having to pay both rent and mortgage, and glad not to own a house that would otherwise sit unattended through a winter, I&amp;#8217;m still a little saddened by it.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,

She sure is cute  Do you hear that noise? Thatâ€™s your parents laughing and crying and jumping up and down because you turned ONE YEAR old, which means we MADE IT! We survived the first year, and here you are laughing, smiling, talking, and nearly walking. One full orbit around the sun and our newborn blob has become a little person with opinions and personality. Dad and I feel like we can finally breathe after 365 days of worry.</description>

      <description>My wife and I have been taking pictures of Sam pretty much whenever she and the camera are in the same room. Alas, the downtime means I have pictures on my internal file server, they have not yet made it up into the now woefully out of date gallery.accapehart.com. My little camera can also take short movies (as you might have seen with the blue angels post). Carolyn will be posting some of these in a new category she calls &amp;#8220;Channel Sam&amp;#8221; and the first of these is up now.</description>

      <description>The Go-Kart racing. That was fun, but I&amp;#8217;m still sore. A bunch of Lindens went down to Burlingame, CA where we went to GoKart Racer Where you do the racing (I guess at other GoKart places, your mom does the racing?)
There were roughly 30 of us there for racing. The sign-in process wasn&amp;#8217;t bad, but was a little slow as we all had to go through a process for which there are a few computers, and of course we arrived as a bunch.</description>

      <description>It was with mixed emotions, (but mostly childlike-delight) that I got to watch the Blue Angels perform over the San Francisco bay near North Beach. The skill and training involved is amazing. The planes themselves are cool, and just seeing the turns they make, their proximity for some maneuvers, their separate coordination for others. It&amp;#8217;s a sight to see.
So, we had quite an afternoon. We drove in (the traffic was maddening) and parked at Linden Lab which was close enough to walk to the Fisherman&amp;#8217;s Wharf area from which we could get a pretty good view.</description>

      <description>Oh boy, oh boy. I love the opportunities afforded us by living in a &amp;#8216;real&amp;#8217; metropolitan area. This afternoon, a bunch of people from our company went Go-Kart racing. And this isn&amp;#8217;t your little neighborhood go-kart track either.. this was racing. With track-jump-suits, helmets, neck braces, and whipping around corners. (Are you sure you don&amp;#8217;t want to come work with us?!?) &amp;#8212; More on this soon, but suffice it to say, I brought home a trophy!</description>

      <description>MonsterFool has already blogged about Sam&amp;#8217;s well-baby visit. But I wanted to include a couple of things that she didn&amp;#8217;t.
1) The pediatrician gave Sam a book &amp;mdash;Rainforest Colors. We were so uncertain that this was really the case, we had to ask at the nurses station on the way out to be sure. They grinned, and confirmed &amp;mdash; every well baby visit from 12-months on, you get a book when you go to the doctor&amp;#8217;s.</description>

      <description>It was a year ago now, that Samantha Fay Capehart came into the world. I&amp;#8217;m amazed at all that&amp;#8217;s happened in the past year &amp;#8212; so many changes in our lives. I&amp;#8217;ll try to wax poetic about them soon, but in the meanwhile, I wanted to wish you a
Happy Birthday, Samantha!</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Iâ€™ve been writing this letter to you in mind for weeks now, but until now I havenâ€™t managed to spill the words onto a page. I hope youâ€™ll cut me a little slack, because, you know, in addition to everything else going on during your 11th month, there was the little matter of that CROSS-COUNTRY move. Oh yes. You began this month in Altoona, PA and ended it in El Cerrito, CA.</description>

      <description>I hesitate to say it for fear of jinxing it, but it looks like we&amp;#8217;re back! This whole process took much longer than I wanted it to (as you might have guessed.) The following factors contributed:
 The machines spent a reasonable amount of time just coming across the country in the moving van
 It took AT&amp;amp;T longer than it should have to get us set up with DSL in our house (especially given the previous resident had DSL set up, and we took over her line, right down to the telephone number!</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Iâ€™m writing this to you in your Uncle Johnâ€™s old room at Gradyville, PA. You are asleep in my old room, clutching a toy car and set of plastic keys. The knees of your purple pants are filthy, your feet are covered in carpet fuzz and cat fur, and your round little tummy rises and falls rhythmically, straining against the straps of the car seat you fell asleep in.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m back in PA with my family. So nice to see them. It drives home my impatience for the resolution of this whole transition though.
I&amp;#8217;m not quite back to my former status with Sam, but I was clearly no stranger either.
The things that struck me most about her after having been gone for almost 2 months:
 Larger: Project Fatbaby has been largely successful.
 More alert: Actually attentive to things rather than just responsive to stimuli</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A good friend of mine has (re-)entered the blog-o-sphere with a blog named &lt;a href=&#34;http://beauframe.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;beauframe&lt;/a&gt;. He starts with a subway story. I recommend you &lt;a href=&#34;http://beauframe.blogspot.com/2006/07/her-name-is-africa.html&#34;&gt;read it first&lt;/a&gt;. His telling of his experience reminded me to blog a somewhat related subway (BART) experience I had recently.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>There was a time when it was perfectly normal to set an alarm to wake Sam up to feed between 2 and 3AM. At the time, those days seemed eternal, stretching out for miles. The notion of sleeping through the night too dim to even imagine in the distance. And then, of course, things changed. Now I am all too happy to forget that old routine.
Here&amp;#8217;s our current routine at Mom-mom and Granddaddy&amp;#8217;s:</description>

      <description>One of the things the I like about being back in a small technology company is the feeling of being more &amp;#8220;in the loop&amp;#8221; for various (memes?) (cultural references?). While I doubt either of these qualify as memes, they both pleased me enough in some way to want to share them with you:
 &amp;#8220;Spock Casa&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; An impressively animated feature of Spock showing off his crib. (1 min) Boten Anna &amp;#8212; Basshunter&amp;#8217;s song about a man who falls in love with an IRC bot.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
I have big shoes to fill (you can take that figuratively or literally, as you like, because yes, your daddy has big feet). Since your daddy spent this past month in California, it is up to me to provide the chronicle of your ninth month.
Nine months! Good lord, child, youâ€™ve now been out for as long as you were in. How did that happen? When I look at your impish smile and the light tripping in your eyes I can barely recall the tiny, sleepy newborn Sam that used to fit along the length of my arm from elbow to palm.</description>

      <description>Not that I needed another reminder about my &amp;#8220;semester abroad&amp;#8221; as Carolyn has referred to my extended absense from my family, but one struck home this morning. I dunno if you use Centrum as a multivitamin, but we do, and I&amp;#8217;ve always wondered why often you buy a big pack, and it&amp;#8217;s got this little travel-sized 30-vitamin container in the same package. Well, I did buy just such a package shortly after I arrived here, and this morning, I consumed the last vitamin from that 30-count container.</description>

      <description>Phew. After almost an entire month of searching, I&amp;#8217;ve finally signed a lease! Carolyn, Sam and I have a place to live in California. Even better, the IRS woes that I mentioned here appear to be resolved.
Suddenly, a 4-day weekend yawns before me with no appointments, and no open houses.
A weight has been lifted.</description>

      <description>My dearest Samantha,
As I start writing this, I&amp;#8217;m on an airplane flying away from you. We&amp;#8217;ll be separated for weeks. Alas, as I look this over for posting, it&amp;#8217;s already almost three weeks later. The job, and the housing search have been consuming my time. I had heard reports from a couple of people who had been out of work for a while about how long the days seemed when they finally were back in the 9-5 workforce.</description>

      <description>Time has been tight out here. This, compounded with a lack of Internet service in the apartment room I&amp;#8217;m subletting has made for a distinct dearth of blog posts. This is unfortunate because there is much to say. Much newness to talk about that I&amp;#8217;m afraid will get lost.
House-hunting has been a miserable experience &amp;#8212; made even harder by the aforementioned lack of connectivity at &amp;#8220;home&amp;#8221;.
I&amp;#8217;m currently having my second sub-par experience at an Internet cafe in north Berkley.</description>

      <description>I cried tonight like I haven&amp;#8217;t in years. I was in transition between one event and another, and Carolyn invited me out onto the screen porch to have a moment. It was dusk, and the thunderstorm was just starting up. It&amp;#8217;s our last night like this in this phase of life.
I sat on the porch and took in the enormity of what feels like should be a small change, a simple shift.</description>

 Thursday, I received a certified letter from the IRS containing a Notice of Deficiency which has to be cleared up in 90 days.
 The relo company &amp;#8212; which has had my approximate schedule for some time now &amp;#8212; now needs 3 weeks advance notice before having a surveyor come walk through the house and tell them how much it will cost to move us. Because it&amp;#8217;s summer.</description>

      <description>I think it was yesterday, maybe it was the day before &amp;#8212; time gets so lost right now &amp;#8212; when Sam made the half of the (stereo-)typical baby noise. She said &amp;#8220;Ga&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; Now all we need is a &amp;#8220;Goo&amp;#8221; to go with it, and we&amp;#8217;ll be set!
Also, people are coming tomorrow to see the house! It&amp;#8217;s still not in great shape, but mostly it&amp;#8217;s just clutter. I&amp;#8217;ve finished the work I want to do to it (mostly thanks to the family helping out last weekend.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve made a page for it, rather than a regular blog entry because I don&amp;#8217;t want it to fade from view (until it&amp;#8217;s sold). We listed our house on Monday with the Real Estate Agent who helped us buy it. It&amp;#8217;s such a treasure &amp;#8212; we don&amp;#8217;t want to leave it behind, but as good as the Linden Lab relocation budget is &amp;#8212; I don&amp;#8217;t think it would actually cover picking up the house and moving it to San Francisco.</description>

      <description>So, we&amp;#8217;ve been madly purging in preparation for this move. It&amp;#8217;s still quite difficult (though I&amp;#8217;ll have a whole mess of computer equipment to offer up shortly. Blog readers get first dibs, though I suspect I&amp;#8217;ll have to go to freecycle to get rid of it). Anyway, I came across a few grad school notes and papers, one notebook of which was full of various labs, tests and notes from my Perceptual Psychology class &amp;#8212; relevant to virtual worlds, of course.</description>

During a long walk during the winter time, Carolyn and I took stock of our lives as we tend to do during long walks together. We found ourselves out in the cold, walking among the depressed (and depressing) houses of Altoona with our baby daughter strapped to us.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,
Wow. Another month whipped by. I can&amp;#8217;t believe how quickly it feels like April went. Of course, for you, it was one seventh of your life, and for me it was about one three hundred and fortieth, so we&amp;#8217;re bound to have at least slightly different takes on it. That said, looking back, your mom and I still managed to come up with a number of things regarding your development that we think noteworthy.</description>

      <description>As you may recall, we had some trouble picking Sam&amp;#8217;s name. While I love my daughter Sam, her name still seems a little random. We wanted something relatively unique, but still not so uncommon as to be a source of teasing, or misunderstanding. The latter was the major strike against Ana&amp;iuml;s &amp;#8212; a name both Carolyn and I like. Alas, the uniqueness was also called into question when within a month of her birth, I received an email from another Samantha Capehart!</description>

      <description>There are plenty of What&amp;#8217;s your [insert topic] name? memes running around &amp;#8212; we even did these before we had the internet to do them with. At the time, the memes (though we didn&amp;#8217;t call them that) were the specific rules that made up your name. For example your soap opera name was made up of your first pet followed by street you grew up on. My soap opera character was the androgynous Buffy Green.</description>

      <description>OK, so this is kind of a Sam post. But since two of these happened today, I thought they should go up.
Real Baby?
Who can tell?  Carolyn and I were walking toward the post office. I was carrying Sam in the baby bj&amp;ouml;rn, and an older woman in one of those golfcart/wheelchair hybrids rolled along toward us. She stopped her cart to ask, in amazement, &amp;#8220;Is that a real baby?</description>

      <description>A reader suggested that maybe it had been far too long since I talked about my darling daughter. And yeah, she&amp;#8217;s right, it has been. I&amp;#8217;m stuck seeking part 2 of the virtual lives thing, and I didn&amp;#8217;t want to interrupt the flow. But, oh well. Sam rocks. She came to watch me play soccer this evening. It&amp;#8217;s so great to have her and mom there. Unfortunately, they are usually ready to go before I am, and since I bring the soccer ball and the cones, when I leave, the party&amp;#8217;s over.</description>

      <description>I wanted to jot down some quick notes as I play Second Life about the nature of online relationships. As I started to write, I felt like I needed to include a little back story. Writing this intro paragraph, I realize that already what follows is too long for a single blog post, and I&amp;#8217;m not even out of the back story yet. That said, I&amp;#8217;m not going to break it up further.</description>

      <description>OK, it&amp;#8217;s not that I&amp;#8217;m always the last to know things. But it seems like I don&amp;#8217;t act very quickly on things that I do hear. (Recall being amazed at photo postage when I saw it &amp;#8212; only 6 months (or more) after I first heard about it).
Well, it&amp;#8217;s happened again. Pandora has been floating around in my periphery for some time now. It&amp;#8217;s a &amp;#8220;music discovery service&amp;#8221; that I just &amp;#8220;discovered&amp;#8221;One of my favorite David Sedaris quotes concerns qualities he was looking for in a boyfriend &amp;#8212; &amp;#8220;He must not say he &amp;#8216;discovered&amp;#8217; a restaurant that was right there in the phone book all along.</description>

      <description>Today, I&amp;#8217;m another year wiser, more mature, experienced and centered. I&amp;#8217;m also another year heavier, achier, creakier and more forgetful. I&amp;#8217;m never really sure what to make of birthdays any more. Somehow, I still have this expectation left over from childhood that they will be magical and wondrous in unimaginable ways. Needless to say, they end up being like most every other day, but for a scattering of presents, well wishes, and maybe a nice meal out.</description>

      <description>The Pennsylvania Turnpike is an expensive but expedient way for us to get back to the Philadelphia area where Mom-mom and Granddaddy live. It is narrow, busy, and often under (much-needed) repair.
When we were in Pittsburgh for Carolyn&amp;#8217;s birthday last year, we picked up whatever the local City Paper-style paper is called. In it, there was an article or editorial lambasting the Pennsylvania Turnpike which, among other things, called it a blight on the face of Pennsylvania.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,

Cute Sam  When I started this, &amp;#8220;monthly&amp;#8221; seemed like the right time frame. In fact, it seemed a little aggressive. Thinking about my own life, it seems that little actually changes month-to-month. Maybe my vocabulary increased by 1 word (this month, it was papabile), maybe I put on a pound, (or took if off if I was lucky). I was worried that I&amp;#8217;d have nothing to say about your growth.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve got a number of unwritten posts in my head. (Albeit a small number.) Still, I wanted to get this one up now because it&amp;#8217;s just too cute.

Sam at Play  The website she&amp;#8217;s playing at is kneebouncers.com which I first wrote about here. She still doesn&amp;#8217;t have the responsive nature of it down. She pretty much mashes the keyboard and watches the screen, but I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure she knows that it reacts to her.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been to the west coast twice in the past 5 years. Each time I&amp;#8217;ve been out there, I&amp;#8217;ve lost a grandmother. I&amp;#8217;m all out of grandmothers. Indeed, Ruth was the last of my grandparents to die. What follows was sent to me by one of my uncles, titled &amp;#8220;Ruth&amp;#8217;s magical journey of magicalness.&amp;#8221; While no life can be adequately expressed in text, especially in just a couple of pages of text, I find that this does give the reader a nice overview and glimpse into life of an extrodinary woman.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m in San Francisco tonight on business. It&amp;#8217;s the first night in my daughter&amp;#8217;s life that we&amp;#8217;ve not slept in the same room. It feels a little odd to be this out of touch &amp;#8212; the flight landed here after I hope both wife and daughter were well asleep.
I&amp;#8217;m in the &amp;#8220;Dirty Harry&amp;#8221; room of the Hotel Bijou. It&amp;#8217;s kinda cool in a funky, downtown-y way. I don&amp;#8217;t know if I&amp;#8217;m exactly in the red light district, but I&amp;#8217;m certainly not in the upscale neighborhood judging by the adult dvd mega stores, and the bars on the windows.</description>

      <description>Sorry I&amp;#8217;ve been so quiet recently. I actually have a few things to say, but have been having trouble focusing on this. Partly because of busy (baby still = handful, + clients, etc.), also because there&amp;#8217;s some stuff going on that I can&amp;#8217;t blog yet. I hate when that happens because I feel like it blocks up the rest of my creativity as well.
Anyway, the only real reason for this entry is to mention that there are a bunch of new pictures up of the world&amp;#8217;s cutest baby.</description>

      <description>Sammy Mammy here. Thanks to all those who sent us your sleep stories, ideas, and encouragement, here in the comments and elsewhere. We&amp;#8217;ve had a variable week. It still takes a while to get Sam to sleep at bedtime, but we&amp;#8217;ve had more success with her naps. One thing that seems to help is not letting her stay up longer than 2 hours at a time, in addition to watching for signs of sleepiness.</description>

      <description>So, sharing videos is not exactly a meme, but I&amp;#8217;ve happened to come across a few recently that I quite enjoyed, though the entire collection below is likely to be interesting only to someone with my particular collection of interests:
 Homemade lightsaber movie (really good): &amp;#8220;http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=672422470842718521&amp;amp;q=ryan+dorkman&amp;amp;#8221;:http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=672422470842718521&amp;amp;q=ryan+dorkman

 Will Wright talks about the really fascinating new game spore: &amp;#8220;http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8372603330420559198&amp;amp;q=spore&amp;amp;#8221;:http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8372603330420559198&amp;amp;q=spore (see also the &amp;#8220;game&amp;#8217;s homepage&amp;#8221;:http://www.spore.com/)

      <description>Dear Readers of ChoicyWhiteBoy:
Help! Sammy Mammy here. Our darling baby Samantha does not want to go to sleep. Ever. Well, she sleeps pretty well between midnight and 6am, getting up once around 2am to eat. But we continue to have a devil of a time getting her to sleep. Nap irregularity during the day we can handle; however, the nightly bedtime battle is really getting to me.
We have been doing the same nightly routine (bath, book, breast) for over a month.</description>

      <description>Samantha,
I&amp;#8217;m just about ready to stop apologizing for the fact that your monthly newsletter, while coming out every month, does not, in fact, come out on (or even very close to) your actual, specific birthday. I&amp;#8217;m a more sporadic blogger than I&amp;#8217;d like to be, and your newsletter suffers somewhat for that fact. Nonetheless, it&amp;#8217;s here now, and I&amp;#8217;m pleased to report that your fifth month was once again a banner month for you.</description>

      <description>Sometimes, product packaging has it just right.
Truth in advertising  Carolyn and I both like pistachios. But I like pistachio pudding, and Carolyn does not. I have a theory as to why &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s the color. I ate (and liked) pistachio pudding as a kid. It was yummy pudding, it was green, and you know, there were nuts in it, but no big deal. I just thought &amp;#8220;pistachio&amp;#8221; was a flavor of pudding &amp;#8212; sort of just a synonym for &amp;#8220;green.</description>

      <description>Something hit me in the middle of the night a couple of nights ago, and it hit hard. I don&amp;#8217;t know what it was, or where it came from. We&amp;#8217;d been out to Sams/Walmart earlier in the day, but I&amp;#8217;d washed my hands as soon as we got home. It started with a pain in the nose, and carried on to be an all out sinus flooding. It was as if my body said &amp;#8220;Why are we letting the little peanut be the top producer of bodily emissions?</description>

It must be true  Hi, I&amp;#8217;m AC Capehart. I&amp;#8217;m a Choicy White Boy.
On this blog, you&amp;#8217;ll find my general musings about life, the occasional thing that I find cool &amp;#8212; usually for its geekyness, and a great deal about my daughter, Samantha. Over time, this blog has evolved as my life has changed. The early part of the blog is just my musings/journaling about my life. Not long into it, my wife becomes pregnant and some number of months later (9-ish?</description>

      <description>The opening scene (photoshopped for modesty)  In the spirit of the (name of the) Vagina Monologues, I bring you &amp;#8220;Conversations with Boobies&amp;#8221; by Samantha Capehart.

 * *Postscript: I showed this to Carolyn for approval before posting (hence the photoshopped for modesty.) She was at the end of nursing, and we played the .wav file. You know how your voice doesn&amp;#8217;t sound the same to you when played back recorded?</description>

      <description>I don&amp;#8217;t often remember my dreams. I don&amp;#8217;t often get enough sleep. (I didn&amp;#8217;t last night either, but when Sam went down for a nap this morning, I just had to join her!)
My dream started in a B&amp;amp;B with large, lush, flowing grounds. We&amp;#8217;d been there for the weekday part of a week with Carolyn&amp;#8217;s parents (and Sam)We&amp;#8217;d been talking about going to see Ca&amp;#8217;s parents some time (once Sam can communicate) where we&amp;#8217;d drop off Sam to stay with her grandparents, and we&amp;#8217;d stay in a nearby hotel a la fussy.</description>

      <description>As I think I mentioned in reporting on Sam&amp;#8217;s most recent pediatric visit, we&amp;#8217;ve learned that now is the time to be helping Sam develop good sleep habits. Everything we&amp;#8217;ve heard is that infants and children do best with routine and that a good bed time ritual can really help the whole household. The child knows what to expect. It ends in sleep, so the whole house is calmer, happier. It&amp;#8217;s all good.</description>

      <description>Steelers Girl  There&amp;#8217;s a skit on Chappelle&amp;#8217;s Show where Dave Chappelle buys a crazy camera from a mysterious dealer. That camera has special powers including seeing the person&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;inner self.&amp;#8221; We went to visit some friends recently, taking Sam along. It appears that our friend must have purchased the same crazy camera as Dave Chappelle because after our visit, he sent us this picture that he took while we were there.</description>

      <description>When my wife and I became new parents, we took advantage of a coupon included with Boppy and subscribed to Parents magazine. I&amp;#8217;ve found some of it useful, but some of it atrocious.
Among the slightly irritating:
 The &amp;#8220;Goody Bag&amp;#8221; included &amp;#8220;binky bling&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; a $35. &amp;#8220;jewel&amp;#8221;-encrusted pacifier and the information that &amp;#8220;Hip moms clip sparkly Binkies to their diaper bags long after their babies outgrow the habit.&amp;#8221; Also in the goody bag: boots that Jennifer Garner &amp;amp; Ben Affleck bought for Violet.</description>

      <description>When I was growing up, I didn&amp;#8217;t have to worry about what my parents wrote about me. Neither of them wrote much. OK, my mom&amp;#8217;s great about letters and cards, and my dad&amp;#8217;s pretty good about postcards from key locations, or travel events. And I know my mom journals. But that kind of communication is, I think, fundamentally different from the public forum of blogging. As I continue to be a daddy blogger, I pay attention to others of the same ilk.</description>

      <description>I have just finished my first WordPress plugin. If you&amp;#8217;ve noticed Sam&amp;#8217;s age popping up at the bottom of posts in the Childhood &amp;amp; Fatherhood category, that&amp;#8217;s my plugin at work. If you&amp;#8217;ve noticed pages not acting quite right, well, that&amp;#8217;s my plugin when it wasn&amp;#8217;t working. 🙂
I think I&amp;#8217;ve gotten it all fixed up now, and am releasing it to the relatively small community of people who read my blog.</description>

      <description>I write a fair amount about my new daughter. Becoming a dad has shifted my life around quite a bit. As I write things about when she first smiled, or first rolled over, it was keeping the date of when those things happened, but the I&amp;#8217;d have to do date-math in my head to figure out how old she was. I don&amp;#8217;t like doing date-math in my head. So, I wrote a wordpress plugin to do it for me.</description>

      <description>This is the parent page for wordpress plugins that I write. It may end up being a fairly small list, but I&amp;#8217;ve been impressed with how easy it is to throw together a plugin for wordpress, so as other wordpress-thorns appear in my side, I may soothe the itch here. In the meanwhile, there&amp;#8217;s just &amp;#8220;Duration&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; A plugin to include how long it has been since some event (or until some event) calculated between the time the post was written, and an arbitrary event set by the blogger.</description>

      <description>I realized today as I was feeding Sam that there were worries that I&amp;#8217;d had when she was younger that I no longer have.
I took a moment to revel in them.
 Breathing &amp;#8212; OK, we aren&amp;#8217;t out of the woods entirely for SIDS at this age, but we&amp;#8217;re past most of the serious danger area. When Sam was a few weeks old, I remember waking up in the night, and not being able to hear her breathe.</description>

      <description>We did it. And it was at least a moderate success. Sam had her first non-milk, non-formula food today! We mixed up some rice cereal with formula, and fed it to her with a spoon. A real (baby) spoon! It&amp;#8217;s hard to tell how much she actually took, as a great deal of it landed on her bib, her clothes, her parents, her chair, her floor, etc. (Not really all that bad.</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;ve taken some grief recently over SamTrak. People seem to think it&amp;#8217;s a bit beyond the pale to be tracking Sam&amp;#8217;s feeding and elimination habits on the Internet. But, there is reason to my madness. Because of her size, we needed to track feeding and elimination. Because it&amp;#8217;s me, it seemed easiest to do this online (access from any computer instead of &amp;#8220;Where&amp;#8217;s the little black poop notebook?&amp;#8221;). Now, I could have done it on my private house-network, but then Carolyn couldn&amp;#8217;t have accessed the information from work.</description>

      <description>Sam had her 4-month checkup at the pediatrician last Thursday, and in addition to shots, got a clean bill of health. Her percentiles are generally up as well, and she has a good weight &amp;#8220;velocity.&amp;#8221; This means that a lot of changes are starting now.
 We&amp;#8217;ll be able to start giving her solids as soon as we like. We need to start setting good bedtime habits and establish a bedtime routine.</description>

      <description>When Mom was away at work, Dad declared that it was time for a fashion shoot. Unfortunately, Dad was so lazy, he didn&amp;#8217;t even go upstairs to get a white sheet as a backdrop, making do, instead, with a few gauzy cloth diapers. It didn&amp;#8217;t come too well, but it&amp;#8217;ll just have to do. So, here you go. Altoona&amp;#8217;s youngest calendar girl is now also a fashion model &amp;#8212; showing off all (well, some) of the 0-3 month styles before she outgrows them.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;#8217;t want to do a blog category on marketing genius, but I&amp;#8217;m afraid it&amp;#8217;s come up again here.
Partly because we have a good friend who&amp;#8217;s a P&amp;amp;G baby, partly because P&amp;amp;G supports Upromise, but mostly (and I really do mean mostly) because it&amp;#8217;s cheap, we buy &amp;#8220;Joy&amp;#8220;dishwashing liquid.
First off, I think &amp;#8220;Joy&amp;#8221; is an odd name for dishwashing liquid. Expecting a chuckle of support and a comment like &amp;#8220;Yeah, why don&amp;#8217;t they call it &amp;#8216;kleenzgud&amp;#8217;?</description>

  Well, Sam, I&amp;#8217;m off to a late start again, but I&amp;#8217;ve not forgotten your newsletter. As in previous months, a lot has changed this month. Highlighting these changes has been your basic physical shape. I&amp;#8217;ve been facinated by reviewing pictures from previous months. Dr. Karp (The Happiest Baby on the Block) talks about the first three months as the &amp;#8220;fourth trimester&amp;#8221; and it was certainly a reasonable description for you.</description>

      <description>I had just finished a long phone conversation with my mom, and was talking it over with Carolyn when we heard what sounded like fireworks outside. I thought it wasn&amp;#8217;t close enough to June to be fireworks season, and then it dawned on me. Maybe the Steelers had won the Superbowl. Altoona is close enough to Pittsburgh that this is considered &amp;#8220;Steeler Country.&amp;#8221; So, I went to superbowl.com and reported, &amp;#8220;Yep, we won.</description>

It was a small group because I announced it so late, but we had fun. We started with Fluxx, then played Kill Dr. Lucky and ended up with some Magic.
I&amp;#8217;m still yawning from the late night, though. And Sam kept Carolyn pretty busy, so she was unable to join us.</description>

      <description>I told Carolyn&amp;#8217;s voicemail the story of the forgotten wallet, and was therefore positively ebullient when she came home from work with two bags of Doritos. In snacking on these, I happened to read a little bit of the packaging. According to the bag, &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s the only snack bold enough to call itself Doritos &amp;reg; brand.&amp;#8221;
Well, yeah. Any other snack that was &amp;#8220;bold enough&amp;#8221; to call itself Doritos would have the pants sued off of them by Frito Lay.</description>

      <description>The most recent troubling forgetfulness happened today. But I need to preface this story with an introduction. I love Doritos. No, seriously, I looove Doritos. They were traveling food when I was a kid. I&amp;#8217;d be in the back seat of the VW bug as we went from Durham, NC up to the Shack in Virginia &amp;#8212; a rustic cabin in the blue ridge mountains. I hated the trip. 3 hours in the car every other weekend or so, but I loved being at the shack.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been forgetful in some genuinely annoying ways the past few days. Last Thursdayactually, it was the Thursday before that. Time sure flies when you&amp;#8217;re forgetful! I was dealing with the car. Nothing special, just checking the oil because of a burning smell. I decided to top it off as it was a little less than half a quart low. I keep the extra oil in one of the compartments in the rear.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m sure that&amp;#8217;s something you&amp;#8217;ve been thinking for some time now. After all, college is just 16-19 years away for darling Samantha. (She might go early, she might take a year off &amp;#8212; She hasn&amp;#8217;t made her preference clear to me yet.) And college is not getting any cheaper. Thanks to some generous donations over the past few years from Grandm&amp;egrave;re and Great-Grandmother Ruth, Sam has a start at a 529 plan college fund.</description>

      <description>We had our &amp;#8220;Class Reunion&amp;#8221; for our Bradley Method Birth class today. It was neat to get together. We&amp;#8217;d actually run across the baby (and dad) from the other couple a day or two ago, but we&amp;#8217;d not seen the Bradley instructor since class, and it was nice to be in a more casual setting (their house).
The babies seemed at best mildly interested in one another. The other baby did spend a reasonable amount of time looking at Sam, but Sam was more interested in looking at Mom.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, Sam got another birth card. This one (ostensibly) came from Governor Ed Rendell, and his wife, Midge. The front looks like a normal congratulatory card. The cover says &amp;#8220;Welcome Little One&amp;#8221; and on the inside, &amp;#8220;The world is one baby sweeter now.&amp;#8221; And then comes the &amp;#8220;personal&amp;#8221; message from Midge &amp;amp; Ed. In handwriting-font, it says &amp;#8220;As parents, we know how precious your baby is to you. Keeping your little one healthy means starting immunizations by two months of age.</description>

      <description>Maybe I just have a dirty mind, but it took me a moment too long to parse this correctly when I heard it the first time:
&amp;#8220;OK, It&amp;#8217;s time for floor play. Do you want to touch your turtle? Here. Touch your turtle.&amp;#8221;
&amp;#8212; Sam touches her turtle.</description>

      <description>In response to this query, I ended up with a 15&amp;#8243; powerbook. It&amp;#8217;s a pretty sweet machine even if they did just replace it with the &amp;#8220;4-times more powerful MacBook.&amp;#8221; I tried an Ubuntu install, but it failed to recognize the Superdrive as a source for the CD &amp;#8212; apparently Apple made some change to the drive with the October(&amp;#8217;05) model updates. There&amp;#8217;s a patch in Gentoo, but not (yet?) in Ubuntu.</description>

      <description>Pop-pop (my dad) arrived yesterday evening, and in so doing, Sam has met her last biological grandparent &amp;#8212; She still hasn&amp;#8217;t met &amp;#8220;Gramma Carolyn&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; Pop-pop&amp;#8217;s wife. I picked up Pop-pop from the Altoona train station after pretty much an all-day Amtrak trip from Richmond, VA. At least the price was right &amp;#8212; less than he&amp;#8217;d have paid in gas to make the drive. In a sense, he met Sam at a good time.</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;#8217;t track the first time she did this, but it&amp;#8217;s also of note that Sam has supported her own weight on her legs, and has been doing so for at least a week. She&amp;#8217;ll &amp;#8220;stand&amp;#8221; up in our laps. I can hold her just above her waist, helping with core balance a little, but she can do all of the standing herself. I think if she just weren&amp;#8217;t so top-heavy with her head, she could probably stand briefly on her own.</description>

 Why is there so much negativity around us? Open a newspaper, watch
TV, listen to the radio, and you find nothing but negative words.
Ever wonder why some words almost always appear in their negative
forms? It&amp;#8217;s completely evitable, as the words for the next five</description>

      <description>Sam rolled over twice today from the much-despised tummy time on to her back. She is 15 weeks old today. I went to get the camera to capture the third time, but there was no third time. Instead, I recorded a couple minutes of a child fussing because she didn&amp;#8217;t want to have to lift that heave head one more time. Or, maybe it was performance anxiety.</description>

      <description>I enjoy puns, and wordplay, possibly to a fault. If I remember, I&amp;#8217;ll post some shaggy dogs at some point.
I read somewhere earlier today about someone sidling up to a bar, and that made me think about the word sidle.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#8217;s one of those words I only know from context, and that context is alwasy sidling up to a bar.&amp;nbsp; I inferred that the definition was just &amp;#8220;to approach&amp;#8221;, but I looked it up today to learn that it means to approach or move sideways (or furtively).</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s curious, though I guess not surprising, that becoming a father has given me some insight into my own childhood and my relationship to my father. A few things are starting to make a little more sense.
The first among these is bear hugs. I&amp;#8217;ve been getting bear hugs from my dad for as long as I can remember. I always kind of figured it was an &amp;#8220;alpha male&amp;#8221; thing. He was showing me that he was big and strong, and I&amp;#8217;d better keep in line.</description>

      <description>It was one year ago today that I started blogging. This would be a good time for self-reflection on what&amp;#8217;s changed in the past year. However, one of the things that&amp;#8217;s changed in the past year, has me up at 3:00 AM warming up formula to feed her, and so I&amp;#8217;m too woozy from need of sleep to be introspective. Maybe something more appropriate will come to me during nap time later in the day.</description>

      <description>Today was Mom&amp;#8217;s first day back at work. Fortunately, as a professor, she has a pretty flexible schedule and is due home within the hour. Still, Sam and I were largely on our own. We&amp;#8217;ve made it so far, though it was touch-and-go for a little while there.
One of the things that we did today before our early-afternoon nap was to go for a walk. It was a beautiful day (for January) here, and I&amp;#8217;ve been noticing the lack of exercise brought about by the combination of having an infant at home and crappy weather outside.</description>

      <description>Dear Sam,

Once again, I find myself writing your monthly newsletter well past the end of your month. I have a little bit better excuse this month &amp;#8212; we were traveling back from Mom-mom and Granddaddy&amp;#8217;s on the day you turned 3 months old. This trip was interestingly exhausting and recharging for me. You didn&amp;#8217;t seem to care much one way or the other, except you seemed to like some of the music you heard while you were there.</description>

      <description>We were actually willing to entertain folks a little while before we left for the holidays, but I never got around to blogging it. Afternoons are best. Please email (or call) to schedule a visit, and give us a call a little before you come over to make sure we&amp;#8217;ve not accidentally just set the house on fire. If you&amp;#8217;re sick, or think you might be, please postpone your visit. She&amp;#8217;ll still be an infant next week too, and we&amp;#8217;ll all be a much happier family if she&amp;#8217;s a well infant next week.</description>

      <description>Just a quick note to say &amp;#8220;Happy New Year.&amp;#8221; The samtrak info that was just posted will be incomplete until we&amp;#8217;re back in Altoona and I have my daughter, wife, cat, food, and high-speed internet access all on the same level of the same house. I can then more easily update the SamTrak data, and I&amp;#8217;ll catch back up on all of the logged I/O. I expect posting activity will pick back up a little then too.</description>

      <description>After YEARS of absolutely HATING when my fine dining experience was RUINED by the piercing, spine-crawling wailing of someone else&amp;#8217;s infant, we braved being the culprits tonight. For the first time since Sam was born, we went out to eat. Not only that, we went out with the in-laws. We went to &amp;#8220;Yang Ming&amp;#8221; in Bryn Mawr &amp;#8212; one of the finer Chinese restaurants in the Philadelphia area.
In the past, we&amp;#8217;ve had a good experience there.</description>

      <description>More accurately, what days! It all started with the ill-fated early morning upgrade. I don&amp;#8217;t even remember what all went wrong any more.
I burned my finger (not badly, just enough to sting for a bit).
I was using the sink in the basement of the in-laws office when it pulled away from the wall. I called for help (sure lucky I had my cell phone on me!). Carolyn and John both came to help.</description>

      <description>I tend to think of the server that my in-laws use for their business: http://www.fayrealestate.com/ as falling in the same category as my other &amp;#8220;personal&amp;#8221; machines &amp;#8212; like the one that hosts this blog, and http://www.santaal.com/ and so forth. I need to start thinking of them as clients instead.
Yesterday, they were having some trouble. I did some investigation and found that a awstats vulnerability had been exploited. I was sure I&amp;#8217;d password-protected the awstats pages, but when I looked through the apache configs, I found no such thing.</description>

      <description>Sam had her first travel of note yesterday. We went from Altoona to the Philadelphia area to start our holiday time with Mom-mom and Grand daddy. It&amp;#8217;s about a 4 hour drive. It took us until about 3:30 PM to finish packing up. The timing of getting an infant packed up to travel is tough because we wanted to do so much for her last minute. Change the diaper just before we leave, feed her just before we leave, etc.</description>

We knew that babies liked to be rocked, but we didn&amp;#8217;t realize that it was true for both the sway gently side to side definition AND the play or dance to rock &amp;#8216;n&amp;#8217; roll definition.
In this case, the three of us were dancing to Apache Indian&amp;#8217;s Boom Shack-a-lak when she konked out. A few of my dance &amp;#8220;moves&amp;#8221; startled her awake &amp;#8212; they would scare most anybody &amp;#8212; but she would drift right back to a contented sleep.</description>

      <description>I was talking with my friend, Rebecca, the visual artist, the other day. I now forget who it was she was ragging on &amp;#8212; some group of geeky or artsy people. She said they had&amp;#8230; I think the description she used was, &amp;#8220;horribly, ugly home pages.&amp;#8221;
I thought that anyone who would offer a critique like that must be pretty proud of how her own home page looked, so I googled her.</description>

      <description>Carolyn and I have started talking about what Christmas &amp;#8220;traditions&amp;#8221; we should start to institute. For that matter, we&amp;#8217;re also talking about how to present Christmas to baby Sam in the future. In many ways, despite the efforts of some true believers, Christmas has become as much a secular holiday as a religious one. As has been noted earlier, I&amp;#8217;m hardly a model Christian, despite agreeing with many of the stated (if not demonstrated) tenets of the faith.</description>

      <description>I just love moments like the one we just had. Sam had finished nursing recently, and I was holding her in the crook of my arm, her tiny body across my chest and belly. She looked up at me and exercised various facial muscles, including sticking her tongue out. A brief fuss storm washed over her, at the end of which, she had the good sense to close her eyes. She quickly fell asleep in my arms.</description>

      <description>No, it&amp;#8217;s not my high school locker combination. It&amp;#8217;s my daughter&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;percentiles&amp;#8221;. We had a visit to the pediatrician today, and among other things, Sam got some measurements taken. At 8lbs, 13 oz, she&amp;#8217;s in the fifth percentile for kids her age (~2.5 months). At 21.5 inches long, her length (height?) is in the 15th percentile. I&amp;#8217;ve forgotten what the raw data for her head circumference is, but it is in the 25th percentile.</description>

      <description>If I&amp;#8217;ve seen the movie, the Exorcist, it was a long time ago. As Carolyn will attest, I don&amp;#8217;t have a head for movies. But some movies are cultural references as much as they are movies and the Exorcist is famous for the kid&amp;#8217;s head spinning around 360 degrees.
Sometimes, I&amp;#8217;m afraid that&amp;#8217;s just what Sam&amp;#8217;s head is about to do. We read somewhere that &amp;#8220;80% of babies prefer to look to the right.</description>

      <description>I now have a new category &amp;#8212; Baby Metrics. It&amp;#8217;s where I&amp;#8217;ll be putting up summary information of the raw data contained in SamTrak. I&amp;#8217;m currently using charting software just for the diaper activity. I&amp;#8217;m undecided on it. It creates Flash graphs, which are pretty cool, but still rub me the wrong way. Maybe for no good reason. I was looking for a gd-based graphing tool and found jpgraph which seemed pretty neat.</description>

In honor of Samâ€™s 10-week birthday, here are 10 Things I Love about Samantha:</description>

      <description>Some days, I&amp;#8217;m just not sure I can do it any more. Take this afternoon, for example. When I got up, mom was kinda short with me. When I asked what was going on, she said that she just needed some time to herself, she was weary and frustrated. I gather it was a rough morning. So, I sent her to Wal*Mart on one of the busiest shopping days of the year to buy diapers and other essentials.</description>

      <description>Today marks the end of using the SNS as a feeding method for Sam. We started it to try to minimize nipple confusion, but still get Sam the calories she needed. At this point, we&amp;#8217;re pretty much resigned to continued use of the nipple shield for as long as Sam breastfeeds. This is pretty frustrating, but our various attempts at weaning her from the shield have been fruitless so far.</description>

      <description>Keeping with the &amp;#8220;it sounds religious, but isn&amp;#8217;t&amp;#8221; theme for today, I thought I&amp;#8217;d mention our Baby Bj&amp;ouml;rn. We&amp;#8217;d heard good things about it, so put it on Sam&amp;#8217;s baby registry, and then promptly bought it for ourselves, because it looked too good to do without. Sam recently gained enough weight that she&amp;#8217;s now above the minimum weight for this thing, so we tried it out today. We got the regular size instead of the extra long thinking that Carolyn would be wearing her, but now we think that may have been a bit silly.</description>

      <description>No, in this case, I&amp;#8217;m not talking about the BVM that so permeates Altoona. I&amp;#8217;m talking about the latest way to calm a crying baby. I think I mentioned in the most recent monthly newsletter that she likes when we dance to music. I tried Madonna. She loved it. She calmed immediately. I wonder how much this will embarrass her in the future?
And am I pleased or sad that this may embarrass her in the future?</description>

      <description>I was reading on The long tail, the blog authored by the editor-in-chief of Wired magazine, that he doesn&amp;#8217;t visit mainstream media sites directly any more. He gets all of his news filtered through a select (but large) group of bloggers, figuring that if it mattered, it would get blogged about, and so he&amp;#8217;d come across it. I had a friend and office-mate that treated a few mailing lists that way.</description>

      <description>This is a geeky post. Non-geeks may safely skip over this post and still have a full breadth of understanding of my life (and Sam&amp;#8217;s, and to a lesser extent Carolyn&amp;#8217;s), or at least as full a one as can be had from this blog.
There, now that that&amp;#8217;s out of the way, let me fill you in on what&amp;#8217;s up. I&amp;#8217;ve seen a few blogs (mostly LJ, but some others) that have a &amp;#8220;mood&amp;#8221; emoticon, and a little &amp;#8220;What I&amp;#8217;m listening to&amp;#8221; bar wherein users can type in the tunes they are currently jamming to.</description>

I was looking for new themes for wordpress, because when I get stuck on what I&amp;#8217;m working on, it&amp;#8217;s easier to fantasize about how my blog could look than fix whatever is stumping me at the moment. One link lead to another lead to stuff on my cat. Of course, they claim to be mentioned in GQ and several other magazines, so it&amp;#8217;s hardly a discovery.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been meaning to write about this first one for a while. In the early days of Sam, we received a lot of stuff. We&amp;#8217;re (Carolyn&amp;#8217;s) gradually making it through our thank-you note list, but one thing remains a mystery. And a fairly significant one too. We received a rocking chair. It was shortly after both Pop-pop and a family friend named &amp;#8220;Jo&amp;#8221; said they&amp;#8217;d send gifts, but gifts from each of them came the same day or shortly thereafter.</description>

      <description>I had been using wordpress as managed by the Ubuntu package management system. This had caused a little bit of trouble because of the way it handled (or didn&amp;#8217;t handle) multiple installations. It more recently became even more trouble because it has PHP4 as a requirement, but I wanted to install something else that had PHP5 as a requirement. I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure that wordpress will do just fine under PHP5, but it would have been auto-un-installed with the move from PHP4 to PHP5.</description>

      <description>Samantha,
Imagine if you will: You&amp;#8217;re on a TGV or Bullet Train. You&amp;#8217;re traveling through snowy, mountainous countryside. As you speed along, you pass through regularly spaced tunnels each a little bit longer and closer than the previous. As a result, it&amp;#8217;s alternately light and dark, and you hear a bit of a whoosh sound as you make each transition. That&amp;#8217;s what this past month has been like for me.</description>

In an effort to show them that we don&amp;#8217;t live in a cultural wasteland &amp;#8212; which, ya know, compared to NYC, we pretty much do &amp;#8212; we showed them my audiotron which gets a variety of international radio stations. As she is Japanese-American, we put on &amp;#8220;Osaka Hit Radio&amp;#8221; and some other Japanese AM (and web-broadcast) radio station.</description>

      <description>Babies like to suck. Babies need to suck if they want to go on living. We&amp;#8217;ve decided not to give Sam a pacifier because, like so much in parenting, there&amp;#8217;s a wealth of information about it, but very little agreement. Good: It can calm the baby. Bad: It can interfere with breastfeeding. Good: It can help reduce the risk of SIDS. Bad: It can be a hard habit to break. Good: Unlike thumbs, it can be taken away.</description>

      <description>I grew up in North Carolina. We didn&amp;#8217;t get much snow. As a kid, we&amp;#8217;d drive to the north for Christmas with my grandparents. I understood that further North meant colder meant greater likelihood of snow. What I didn&amp;#8217;t understand was that Richmond, VA &amp;#8212; not so much &amp;#8220;North.&amp;#8221; Still, we&amp;#8217;d take my sled up, strapped to the bike rack on the back of the family VW bug. And it did snow, in Richmond, just enough to keep a kid&amp;#8217;s hope up &amp;#8212; though an actual white Christmas was still pretty rare.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;#8217;s something I hate: Reaching down to pick up a piece of dirt off the laminate floor only to discover, after I&amp;#8217;ve squeezed it between my fingers, that it&amp;#8217;s the kind of dirt that comes out of the back of my cat.</description>

      <description>h2. What they have in common
 When she wants to be fed, she wants to be fed now, and she&amp;#8217;ll keep telling you that until you feed her.
 She hates having her claws clipped.
 Pooping is an any time any where sort of event.
 She like to fall asleep leaning on daddy.
 She naps like it&amp;#8217;s going out of style.
 She loves being where it&amp;#8217;s warm.</description>

      <description>Sam has begun vocalizations that aren&amp;#8217;t cries. For the most part, they are simply cry-parts vocalized outside of a period of fussyness. So instead of saying &amp;#8220;waaannnh&amp;#8221;, she&amp;#8217;ll bust out with just the occasional &amp;#8220;aannh&amp;#8221;. She&amp;#8217;s made a few others though. Being careful not to project interpretations of French professor mommy and gamer daddy, we&amp;#8217;re pretty sure she wants to go to Arles(pronounced &amp;#8220;aahrl&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s in France) where she will play GURPS(pronounced a lot like a hiccup &amp;#8212; presumably 4th edition).</description>

      <description>As we&amp;#8217;re approaching the 6-week-old threshold, it&amp;#8217;s becoming time to introduce the bottle to Sam so that I can feed her while Ca&amp;#8217;s back at work. In so doing, we&amp;#8217;re trying to figure out what nipple to use for the bottles. We want one that&amp;#8217;s least likely to cause &amp;#8220;nipple confusion&amp;#8221; wherein the baby decides that food comes from bottle nipples and starts rejecting the mom-based kind. Therefore, Carolyn is doing nipple research on the Internet.</description>

      <description>Newborns get all kinds of screens. One of the ones I had been insisting on was the one for Cystic Fibrosis (CF) &amp;#8212; I had an aunt die of CF, and so statistically, I had a pretty good chance to be a CF carrier. When the pediatrician said that we&amp;#8217;d get the CF screen at the one month checkup, I thought that she meant that they&amp;#8217;d take the blood for the screen then.</description>

      <description>Dear Samantha,
As I write you this first of monthly newsletters, you are asleep in my lap. One of your arms is raised straight up in the air, fingers spread wide, with your index finger slightly forward of the rest of the arc of your fingers. If I could reach the camera without disturbing your rest, I&amp;#8217;d definitely be preserving this for posterity. I enjoy how you still don&amp;#8217;t quite understand that the various parts of your body belong to you, and while there are ways in which I&amp;#8217;m very much looking forward to your maturation, I will miss this phase.</description>

      <description>We took Sam to the pediatrician today for her weekly weight check. We were hoping that she&amp;#8217;d have followed the instructions and gained 7 ounces in the past 7 days. Doing so would have brought her up to 6 pounds, 3 ounces. Instead, she was 6 pounds, 4.4 oz! So, we&amp;#8217;re going to keep doing whatever it is we&amp;#8217;ve been doing at least until we go back to the doctor&amp;#8217;s for her one-month check up next Monday.</description>

      <description>Sam is 4 weeks old today, but other than that, I don&amp;#8217;t have a lot to say about her. She continues to eat, sleep, poop and pee. Sometimes she&amp;#8217;s relaxed and engaged. Sometimes, she&amp;#8217;s inconsolably cranky. In the tradition of Heather Armstrong, I will start a monthly journal &amp;#8212; a newsletter to Sam, but that won&amp;#8217;t come out for another couple of days &amp;#8212; on her one month birthday.
Mom and dad are starting to get into a little more of a routine, but there&amp;#8217;s still not enough sleep to go around.</description>

This is good because while I have a fleet of computers, they&amp;#8217;re all old and getting older. My newest one is about 3 years old &amp;#8212; about the usable lifespan of a computer. I&amp;#8217;m trying to decide what computer to get next and am soliciting your input.
So far in my life, I&amp;#8217;ve never purchased a laptop for myself.</description>

      <description>Up here in central PA, I get my natural gas supply from Dominion. This confuses me just a little bit, because back in Charlottesville, I got my electricity supply from Dominion (gas came from the City of Charlottesville).
They recently sent me their furnace repair plan promotional material. Basically, they offer furnace insurance. Pay a little bit every month, then if your furnace fails, they fix it and you aren&amp;#8217;t stuck with a huge repair bill.</description>

Being that we now live in a proper neighborhood, complete with neighbors, and now that we have a kid, it seems like it is time to start participating in the whole Halloween thing again. We bought a great deal of candy. We turned on our front porch (and lamp post) lights.</description>

      <description>We went back to the pediatrician&amp;#8217;s office today. I think I may have mentioned earlier that Sam&amp;#8217;s supposed to be gaining an ounce a day at this stage of life. So, she should have gained 7 ounces since we were last there. She gained 3.1. She&amp;#8217;s now at 5lbs, 11 oz. We&amp;#8217;ve been told to increase the frequency of the supplements &amp;#8212; We&amp;#8217;d been doing 2 a day. We&amp;#8217;re now going for 3-4.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve had some pretty good birthdays. Even this year, I had one that I really enjoyed. But, already, Sam has topped me. Just yesterday, 3 more packages came for Sam from such unlikely sources as the parents of my best friend from mid-late youth, and an administrative assistant that we rarely deal with any more from the campus. The outpouring has been amazing. Thank you. If you&amp;#8217;re still thinking to join in on the give Sam stuff parade, I have just one request &amp;#8212; no more &amp;#8220;Goodnight Moon.</description>

      <description>Well, Grand-m&amp;egrave;re left early afternoon today, right after breakfast. Yeah, you read that right. What of it? Now we&amp;#8217;re out of biological grandmothers. OK, Sam has one more grandmother (my dad&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;new&amp;#8221; wife). She&amp;#8217;s been part of my dad&amp;#8217;s life for years and years, but she still doesn&amp;#8217;t really feel like family the same way to me. No offense meant, just that Carolyn and I each had mothers during our childhoods, neither of which she was.</description>

      <description>We went to the pediatrician yesterday for a weight check. She did pretty good. Last time we were there, she was 5lbs, 3.9 oz. (birth weight was 5lbs, 3.5oz). This time, she was 5lbs, 8.6oz. Apparently, the rule of thumb for this phase of life is &amp;#8220;an ounce a day.&amp;#8221; 4.7 ounces was apparently close enough for 5 days. We&amp;#8217;re still a little stressed about her weight gain though. As I think I mentioned, we&amp;#8217;re supplementing her intake with formula, and we increased the quantity some in the last few days to make sure she&amp;#8217;s growing.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve heard from a couple of people now that they&amp;#8217;ve had trouble accessing Samantha&amp;#8217;s website, or SamTrak from her site. I suspect DNS trouble. I set these sorts of things up with some regularity, so I should have a pretty good idea of what to do. Alas, I usually do it on more sleep than I had recently, so I could have screwed something up. It all works for me, but I use my own DNS servers.</description>

      <description>They say that the poop of newborn, breast fed babies looks like mustard (complete with seeds), and on good days, that&amp;#8217;s proving true. (Bad days, it&amp;#8217;s greener and wetter, but you didn&amp;#8217;t really want to know that, now did you?) They also say that it changes parents&amp;#8217; view of mustard at least during this phase of development. For me, it&amp;#8217;s been mostly the other way. Instead of thinking that I have a jar of baby poop labeled &amp;#8220;Dijon&amp;#8221; in my refrigerator, I think &amp;#8220;Cool, my baby poops fine French mustard!</description>

      <description>You might think that since Grand-m&amp;egrave;re is a formal French title, that it might have something to do with Mom&amp;#8217;s side of the family. After all, Mom studies all sorts of things French. And while neither side of the family stands greatly on formality, you&amp;#8217;ll find fewer fart jokes told around the dinner table with Mom&amp;#8217;s side of the family. But no, you&amp;#8217;d be mistaken. OK, it&amp;#8217;s not much of a fairy tale, but here&amp;#8217;s the story of how Grand-m&amp;egrave;re got her name.</description>

      <description>We met with a different pediatrician today (same office). I was worried about Sam&amp;#8217;s wheezing &amp;#8212; especially as I was just getting over a cold myself. It turned out to be nothing but regular snot, but I&amp;#8217;m so glad we went. We had a much easier time communicating with this pediatrician than we did for Sam&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;regular&amp;#8221; doctor. While her regular doctor has a fine command of English (though it&amp;#8217;s not her native tongue), we don&amp;#8217;t feel like she listens to us and our questions particularly well.</description>

      <description>We made it from one grandmother to the next. Phew. Already Grand-m&amp;egrave;re&amp;#8217;s been a big help. She&amp;#8217;s returned a book to the library that would have been late tomorrow, she&amp;#8217;s gone to the grocery store and she&amp;#8217;s helping get the nursery prepped for the Trading Spaces style event down the road. This was a good thing because I hadn&amp;#8217;t even been in that room for most of a month. The windows were open because, it had been summer not that long ago.</description>

      <description>Mom-mom left this morning. And while my life isn&amp;#8217;t really one Simpsons reference after another, it feels a little bit like the &amp;#8220;Sherry Bobbins&amp;#8221; episode where a Mary Poppins-esque figure comes to the Simpson home. By the end of her stay, they&amp;#8217;re all neat, well-attired, and speaking with British accents. But, the very instant she steps out of the house, they&amp;#8217;re suddenly twice as bad as before she came.
Truthfully, it&amp;#8217;s not that bad (yet).</description>

      <description>It is 7:30 PM and no nurse has called to say that (s)he will be there in about half an hour to stick needles in little Sam&amp;#8217;s legs. No one is coming to weigh her. To ask how many wet and dirty diapers she had, to listen to her pulse, or to her breathing.
The forms they filled out for each visit were entertaining, and at least a little troublesome. Mostly, they used the &amp;#8220;6 Weeks &amp;#8212; 16 Years of Age&amp;#8221; form.</description>

      <description>We have an &amp;#8220;American Baby&amp;#8221; magazine which has various developmental milestones for babies. One of the &amp;#8220;Intellectual&amp;#8221; milestones under the &amp;#8220;1 Week&amp;#8221; category is &amp;#8220;Shuts out disturbing stimuli by lapsing into sleep.&amp;#8221; This brought a couple of things to mind.
 Wouldn&amp;#8217;t it be funny if this continued into adulthood? &amp;#8220;Oh no! The Huns are invad&amp;#8230;ZZZZZZZ&amp;#8221;
 I wonder if that&amp;#8217;s why she falls asleep in my arms so readily? &amp;#8220;Oh my god, what&amp;#8217;s that smell?</description>

      <description>It has been pointed out in a couple of venues how remiss I&amp;#8217;ve been in providing visual accompaniment to the Sam lifestyle. Fortunately, Mom-mom has taken several pictures, and posted them to her album at Sony&amp;#8217;s image station. She invited me to it so that I could invite you to it:

      <description>I was at PSU Altoona recently running errands and managed to see a few people. I was impressed by the number of people who are up to date on what&amp;#8217;s going on with Carolyn, Sam and myself based on reading my blog. It&amp;#8217;s still disarming when there are people in France (Salut Peggy, Salut Tara) who know more details about the birth of my child than my own parents. I am also amused by who does and doesn&amp;#8217;t read my blog on campus.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;#8217;t like to ask for help. I was raised to be an independent and self-sufficient individual, given more freedom and responsibility than most my age. This is doubly true when what I ask for help on is something that I am not only capable of doing myself, but should have already done. And it&amp;#8217;s still the more true when I&amp;#8217;m asking of a community of friends who have already been so incredibly generous.</description>

      <description>As we approach Sam&amp;#8217;s one-week anniversary, there are a couple of elements of the birth story that I&amp;#8217;ve not yet mentioned, but want to. But first, I can&amp;#8217;t believe it&amp;#8217;s been a whole week. Nor can I believe it&amp;#8217;s been only a week. It seems a world ago that we were breathing through the contractions. At the same time, it&amp;#8217;s been such a hectic whirlwind since, were there really 7 whole dark, night-like entities since then?</description>

      <description>I know, it&amp;#8217;s well past time for an update. What can I say? Busy day. So far, in Sam&amp;#8217;s life, there has not been a day when she has not had to go to the hospital. Hopefully, tomorrow will break this trend. I think I mentioned before that we&amp;#8217;ve got home health nurses coming twice a day to inject Sam with ampacillin. So far, the two nurses we&amp;#8217;ve had have been exceptionally caring and considerate people.</description>

      <description>OMG. I really can&amp;#8217;t believe what a nightmare this has become. Because Sam might have group b strep, we&amp;#8217;ve had to take her to the ER. We had to take her in only a few hours after we brought her home. (It&amp;#8217;s a half hour drive.) We had to take her in again this morning. We did. While we were there, the head nurse from &amp;#8220;Special Delivery&amp;#8221; came by. She said she thought it was stupid for dead-tired parents to drive a half an hour in each direction, and take a 3 to 4 day old, undersized baby into an emergency waiting room full of sick people twice a day.</description>

      <description>Mom-mom came today and she brought a treasure trove of outfits. Mostly from herself and grandaddy, but also from other Philadelphia area relatives. I&amp;#8217;m astonished at how much pink is suddenly in our house. One of the nice side effects of not having known the gender pre-birth is the neutral colors and style. But pink and dresses now abound. Not that she doesn&amp;#8217;t look cute as a button in a pink dress, but oh how early the gender stereotyping begins!</description>

      <description>We made it home. I was pleased. It was starting to feel manageable. I was even pretty close to being in a situation where I could upload some pictures when the midwife called and said that the placental culture was back and it had tested positive for group B Strep. A little later, a nurse from Nason special delivery calls. The pediatrician is worried that Sam might have it too, so they need to draw blood to check that, but the test takes 48 hours, so she needs to get antibiotic shots every 12 hours between now and the return of the test results.</description>

      <description>Sam will probably cringe and grimace when she gets old enough to read this and she sees the details I&amp;#8217;m sharing about her first days. But that&amp;#8217;s one of the key roles of parents-to embarass us beyond belief.
Today&amp;#8217;s embarassing tale is about urine. We were worried that she simply wasn&amp;#8217;t doing it. We change (or at least inspect) diapers with every feeding. We&amp;#8217;ve seen a couple of really good poops, but no pee.</description>

      <description>The first day of life has been a little rough. Mom and dad already need to be getting more sleep than they are. Breastfeeding didn&amp;#8217;t start easily despite a pretty good understanding of how it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;supposed&amp;#8221; to go. Recently, dad&amp;#8217;s been feeding Sam a special high-calorie formula from a small tube run along his pinkie finger. All sorts of pictures are being taken. Several of which are appropriate for a broader audience and so will find their way here or at least in the gallery, but not until all three of us come home (expected to be Tuesday morning.</description>

Our baby girl arrived just before 1:00 AM on Sunday, Oct. 2. She&amp;#8217;s a small one &amp;#8211; I don&amp;#8217;t have the length yet, Ca thinks she heard 17 inches &amp;#8211; but she&amp;#8217;s 5 pounds 4 ounces, we got to see that measurement take place. They were a bit worried about her right after birth, so they whisked her away for a while.</description>

      <description>At 6:00 the midwife wanted to break the water. She had done a test and we were stuck at 4cm. We managed to get an hour&amp;#8217;s reprive, which is just about up. I hope we&amp;#8217;ve progressed enough to further forstall it, but we&amp;#8217;ll see soon enough. The contractions are still irregular and manageable.</description>

      <description>For a while recently, Carolyn was having what they were calling &amp;#8220;late decells&amp;#8221;. Meaning that baby&amp;#8217;s heart rate was dropping (_decel_lerating) during the late part of contractions. This apparently means that baby is not tolerating the contractions well &amp;#8212; not getting enough oxygen during them so the heart rate declines. So, at the moment, the pit is off, Carolyn&amp;#8217;s on oxygen and resting. I&amp;#8217;m going to see if I can cat nap too.</description>

      <description>We had a bit of drama recently. The pitocin (actually oxytocin) level had been gradually pumped up to 8 mili-units. The contractions were coming a bit more regularly, but were still well under controll. Carolyn had been having some twinges of lower back pain, so the doula suggested a hands and knees position to try to pull the baby forward some. In that position, Carolyn felt no contractions at all, and none showed on the monitor.</description>

      <description>Carolyn is now on pitocin. They just upped the dose from the minimum they started her out on about 20 min. ago. The contractions are more frequent, but still pretty managable. She can talk through them. She greeted the most recent one with &amp;#8220;Oooh, here&amp;#8217;s one.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>No Internet access at the hospital. Will have to use my phone for subsequent updates. I really should have bought that keyboard for it. Oh well. We got checked in after a crazy afternoon of finishing packing and a quick meal at the local Mexican joint. Already, it&amp;#8217;s far more medical than I was prepared for, though I mean it&amp;#8217;s a hospital, I should have known. But she&amp;#8217;s had 3 vials of blood drawn, I don&amp;#8217;t even know for what.</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;re in a bit of a collective freak-out at the moment. We went in for our usual &amp;#8220;non-stress&amp;#8221; test and Biophysical profile (ultrasound) today. The BPP score was a 4 out of 8. They didn&amp;#8217;t see sufficient movement, nor fetal breathing. (I wish we&amp;#8217;d had the other ultrasound technician.) So, even though our non-stress test was fine, the doctor feels like the baby is now in a &amp;#8220;better out than in&amp;#8221; place.</description>

      <description>I find myself, at 10:00 in the evening, sitting in the basement illuminated only by the monitor and a small desk light, blasting techno through my headphones, and programming. Sometimes, life is gooood.</description>

      <description>We had Donna and Rebecca over for dinner tonight. They are the two amazing women who put together the wonderful baby shower for Carolyn, helped me paint rooms in the house, etc. They&amp;#8217;ve been quite a treat to have in our lives. Anyway, Rebecca brought over a CD of photos that she took at the event, so I uploaded them into the photo gallery.
 Also, this week, I got a couple of pictures of my friend David.</description>

      <description>Today, I received my Official Coach Card indicating that Carolyn and I have completed our Bradley Method training in preparing for a &amp;#8220;natural&amp;#8221; birth. I (and I believe Carolyn) certainly benefited greatly from Tera Nelson&amp;#8217;s training, and feel much more prepared now than I(we) did even a scant month ago. Still, there&amp;#8217;s a twinge of nervousness (sometimes more like panic) about this very physical and quite unknown (to us) process that we have coming up.</description>

      <description>A while back, I took my car into the dealer for service. Since Carolyn gave her car back to her parents, we have just the one vehicle. I dropped her off at work, then dropped the car off at the dealer. I had to use the courtesy shuttle to get back home. I told the driver where I lived, and off we went. Soon, he turned off of the route that I expected him to take.</description>

      <description>About a month ago, I misplaced my pocket knife. Were I still living under my dad&amp;#8217;s roof, this would have been cause for great concern. &amp;#8220;A man without his pocketknife is a man without his pants,&amp;#8221; he would say. But I wasn&amp;#8217;t too worried. I was pretty sure it was still in the house, I also carry a leatherman tool on my belt, and I have a backup pocketknife. I found that I didn&amp;#8217;t carry the backup pocketknife though because it was too heavy; Too much weight bouncing around in my pocket.</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;re putting together a birth notebook to take with us to the delivery room filled with things from the practical (contact numbers, insurance information) to the baby-specific (birth plan, notes from Bradley class) to the relaxing (to help Carolyn through the experience without medication.) One of the things Carolyn picked out for me to potentially read to her were some passages from the Tao Te Ching. She picked a couple of my favorites.</description>

      <description>My current favorite mixed drink is the Irish Monk &amp;#8212; at least the recipe found in the &amp;#8220;Ultimate Bartender&amp;#8217;s Guide&amp;#8221;. It&amp;#8217;s a simple drink, which is part of why I like it. Easy to mix means less time screwing around, and more time drinking.
 2 oz. Jameson Irish Whiskey
2 oz. Frangelico
Pour Whiskey and Frangelico into glass filled with ice. Stir.
 It goes down smooth with the Frangelico cutting the whiskey and giving its own nutty flavor to the drink.</description>

      <description>For reasons that I won&amp;#8217;t go into here (If you&amp;#8217;re lucky, maybe I&amp;#8217;ll tell you later. If you&amp;#8217;re really lucky, maybe you can guess.) I Googled on &amp;#8220;PBF NSFW&amp;#8221;. (OK, Actually, I A9&amp;#8217;ed. I like saving money at Amazon). Anyway, the first link was just PBF archive. I went. I saw that &amp;#8220;PBF&amp;#8221; stood for &amp;#8220;Perry Bible Fellowship&amp;#8221;, and I stopped right there. After all, I had just done a Google (and yes, this time I mean Google) blogsearch on Altoona, and found the top entry was the Altoona First Southern Baptist Church Men&amp;#8217;s Ministry Blog.</description>

I&amp;#8217;ve even played with the idea of taking the bait and toying with the scammers a-la those at 419 eaters. But in wasting their time, I&amp;#8217;d also be wasting my own.
Today, however, I received a variant of the letter appealing to my desire to help Katrina victims:

I&amp;#8217;m a pretty strong believer in letting others live on the bleeding edge. And while Gallery 2.0, is certainly a &amp;#8220;dot-oh&amp;#8221;, I suspect it&amp;#8217;s pretty well tested having been in design and development for 3 years through through 4 alpha releases, 4 beta releases and 2 release candidates. So, I&amp;#8217;ve created gallery2.</description>

      <description>Reviewing links on Choicy White Boy, I noticed that there&amp;#8217;s a link to the blog of the Author of the WordPress Theme I&amp;#8217;m using (journalized-winter). I checked it out, and saw that he had a &amp;#8220;nerd score&amp;#8221; of 92. Pretty nerdy, I thought. So, I took the quiz. I should learn not to take quizes. In other online quizes, I learned that I was a satanist, who my &amp;#8220;inner rock star&amp;#8221; was (Chris Isaac?</description>

      <description>Now that Carolyn&amp;#8217;s 36 weeks pregnant, we get to go to the OB/GYN twice a week. Today was &amp;#8220;just&amp;#8221; a non-stress test &amp;#8211; almost a half hour, and an office visit. The office visit was interesting in that we met the doctor for the first time. Up until now, we&amp;#8217;ve only been seeing the midwives.
Dr. Littlejohn was an interesting character. We learned that he is a HAM radio enthusiast and that he went war-driving around Altoona with his son, finding hundreds of open wireless networks.</description>

      <description>My Dad was recognized by the Raleigh News and Observer as their Tar Heel of the Week this week. From the article, I enjoyed the quotes most because I can really hear his voice in some of those phrases. Things like &amp;#8220;You enter into a whole new concept by going back to what used to be.&amp;#8221; I assure you his hands were parallel and up by his head as he was saying that.</description>

      <description>Thanks to the Neon Guild I was just exposed to an exceptional article on computer (and network) security. The article is well-written, easy to read, and an important reminder to anyone that administers a network. Author Marcus Ranum is recognized as the inventor of the proxy firewall, and the implementor of the first commercial firewall product, and it&amp;#8217;s quite pleasant to come across a technologist who is readable in print. I&amp;#8217;m going to add this link to My Wiki as well, as it is doubtless something I&amp;#8217;ll need to re-read every few months.</description>

The mailing list can be found at http://www.chaoslimited.com/mailman/listinfo/birth &amp;#8211; Moderator (my) approval is required for subscrption so that I can limit the email to people I know&amp;#8211;even if the same info will appear on the blog mere minutes later.</description>

(Don&amp;#8217;t worry, I&amp;#8217;ll know what it is you voted for and use that one, regardless of what the rest of the poll says 😉 )</description>

Carolyn said I shouldn&amp;#8217;t do it. But I did. I got &amp;#8220;choicywhiteboy.com&amp;#8221;. I don&amp;#8217;t think there&amp;#8217;s going to be a rush on the domain. It only has meaning for me. But this way blog title and address can sync up &amp;#8212; you only have to remember one! For that matter, I took the next logical step and got the AIM ID &amp;#8220;choicywhiteboy&amp;#8221;. I wonder if I&amp;#8217;m going to get as tired of this name as I did of A Life More Ordinary.</description>

      <description>OK, it&amp;#8217;s lantern light, not candle light, but the idea&amp;#8217;s pretty similar. And I&amp;#8217;ve been doing a lot of it lately.
Maybe a couple of weeks after I penned The bk Life, bk asked me if I&amp;#8217;d computed on the back porch again. At the time I had not. But the weather has been too beautiful here to stay in the basement. I&amp;#8217;ve got a mouse, and I&amp;#8217;m more-or-less used to the screen size.</description>

This is a simple test of a plugin I just got for wordpress to hook up wordpress to gallery. If it works, there&amp;#8217;ll be an ultrasound picture above this. If it doesn&amp;#8217;t, then I&amp;#8217;ll be editing it until it does work. But not until after dinner. 😉
Well, it appears that I got it working. But I&amp;#8217;m still not sure I&amp;#8217;m satisfied. I think I want an intermediate size for in-blog pictures.</description>

      <description>There are a couple of things I&amp;#8217;m tempted to do/start with this blog. The first is to make it my home page. I don&amp;#8217;t think there&amp;#8217;s any content on the home page that&amp;#8217;s not (or couldn&amp;#8217;t be) on this page. And why come to a mostly dead home page when the life is going on underneith?
I&amp;#8217;m also tempted to start a section (or at least a category) called &amp;#8220;Other people&amp;#8217;s stories.</description>

      <description>We reached the end of Farscape today. It was a fun show. I liked it and recommend it, but somehow, it never grabbed me the way I expected it to. Maybe my expectations were set too high. Maybe I&amp;#8217;ve been jaded by the predictable pattern of hero gets into trouble through no fault of his/her own. Hero gets out of trouble through use of skill/smarts/wit/humanity/whatever, all in the course of an hour.</description>

      <description>I meant to post this on the second instead of almost a week later. So, I&amp;#8217;m going to back-date this one. Maybe you&amp;#8217;ll see it, maybe not. Anyway, Gary Larson&amp;#8217;s The Far Side is probably my second-favorite comic strip ever (behind Bill Waterson&amp;#8217;sCalvin and Hobbes). During my junior year of college, I was an RA, and already pretty well acknowledged as a gamer much more than a studier. When this particular strip came out (10/15/90 apparently), some people thought it might resonate with me.</description>

      <description>Carolyn and I had a perinatal day today. We had a fetal ultrasound with biophysical profile. We had an OB/GYN appointment. We had a quote &amp;#8220;non-stress&amp;#8220; test. Carolyn peed in a cup. (OK, to be fair, she has to pee in a cup every time we go to the OB/GYN [at their request, not her whim], but still, it was a long-ish day of poking and prodding.)
All of this (well most of this) because she&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;measuring small.</description>

I know what they meant of course. Still, it&amp;#8217;s interesting the slant. Also not surprising, but interestingly phrased: &amp;#8220;More of those who believe in creationism said they were &amp;#8220;very certain&amp;#8221; of their views (63 percent), compared with those who believe in evolution (32 percent).</description>

      <description>We met today with the local Bradley Method instructor. We were originally going to be attending a Bradley class, but she needed 3 couples to hold the course. So, instead we were going to have a little mini-tutorial. But then another couple contacted her (today?!?) and signed up. It&amp;#8217;s a 12 week course. We have only about 5 weeks left before the due date (assuming the baby is neither tardy nor hasty.</description>

      <description>I know, not very interesting for an actual entry. I just wanted to set up and test making blog entries from my phone. I suspect it will be my input method from the LDRP room.</description>

      <description>This is not a press release; Amazon.com&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;operating agreement&amp;#8221;:http://associates.amazon.com/gp/associates/agreement/103-7418193-3929441 specifically forbids my issuing a press release. But, this is a blog entry that mentions that I&amp;#8217;ve become an amazon &amp;#8220;affiliate.&amp;#8221; This just means that the links that I make to amazon have some remote chance of earning me a little bit of money. Actually, I&amp;#8217;m set up so they&amp;#8217;ll earn me amazon gift certificate instead of money.
That I became an Amazon affiliate, I probably wouldn&amp;#8217;t mention except that I was amused by the automatically-chosen associate ID.</description>

      <description>We started the hunt for pediatric care today. Actually, we started a while ago, but we met our first potential pediatrician today &amp;#8212; a Dr. Delbaggio with &amp;#8220;Blair Medial Associates&amp;#8221;:http://www.blairmedicalassociates.com/peds.html. She seemed friendly and competent, but Blair Medial Associates is one of those large medical-industrial complex places. During the course of the interview we learned that we&amp;#8217;d be among the 10,000 patients that they currently service. How can you have a personal, caring relationship with 10,000 people?</description>

      <description>OK. I&amp;#8217;m declaring my blog &amp;#8220;done enough&amp;#8221; at this point. I&amp;#8217;ve re-introduced the Google &amp;#8220;AdSense&amp;#8221; ads. Which, as I&amp;#8217;m sure you know is important to my revenue plans for this site. I&amp;#8217;ve earned an average of a little over 43 cents every month since I started Adsense. Of course, they don&amp;#8217;t cut a check until you&amp;#8217;ve accumulcated a credit of $100. At this rate, I&amp;#8217;ll get my first check in 19.</description>

      <description>I spent far too much of today copying the old blogger entries into wordpress. I suspect it was still faster than writing a parser to scan previous entries and dump them into the mysql database that wordpress uses, though I&amp;#8217;m not sure. The main thing that I&amp;#8217;ve not done is to move over the image-only posts. Oh, and figure out comments. There were several nice and interesting comments that elaborated on entries that will be lost with the current transition.</description>

      <description>Last weekend we spent in West Townshend, VT at the Windham Hill Inn. The occasion was the wedding of my brother-in-law John Fay to Rika Suzuki.
There is a lifestyle that I am impressed with when I get these fleeting glimpses of it. I saw it in a couple of the Newscorp politicos that I worked with when Kesmai was a Newscorp entity. I caught several glimpses of it last weekend.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;d been thinking about switching blog tools for a while. I liked blogger, but I wasn&amp;#8217;t completely satisfied with it. Mainly, I was missing having categories. Then, I started installing a new machine to act as the primary server for accapehart.com. I got it serving web pages no problem. However, because it has a different SSH host identity, but the same username/password/IP Address, blogger failed to connect to it. So, I wrote to blogger support.</description>

      <description>When the web was infantile, there was no real way to know what was new. During its toddler stage, information about new websites was passed around via email or on USENET. Eventually, there became too many sites being created for this to be a reasonable way to keep up. (A similar issue plagued the single /etc/hosts file, but that&amp;#8217;s a different story.)
Finally, there came Yahoo. Now, there was a directory for the web.</description>

      <description>I know why we&amp;#8217;re in Altoona. I even appreciate it. I like the new friends we&amp;#8217;ve made. But I miss the comfort and convenience of old friends. Even some colleagues from Kesmai. There are enough stocky people with dark hair that every now and again I think I see Stuart Holme in the distance. I miss his uncomplicated appreciation of life. I miss my friend Nancy (not a Charlottesvillian) with whom I seem to often have an understanding that exists outside of spoken communication.</description>

      <description>[rant]
As you probably know, we bought a house recently. With that sort of thing comes taxes. For the actual sale itself, the state takes 2%. 1% is paid directly to the state by the borrower, the other 1% is paid by the borrower first to the seller who then pays it to the state.
Then there are property taxes. Because I own property, the state lays claim to some of my money based again on either what I paid for that property, or (often worse) what it thinks I could get for it if I sold it.</description>

      <description>Maybe not everybody else knows about this, but I sure felt out of the loop when I discovered it. I saw my first PhotoStamp today. The photo&amp;#8217;s of my uncle&amp;#8217;s first grandchild. It was on a card he sent my mom. MY MOM knew about photostamps before I did. Sometimes, I get the false impression that because things in Altoona seem to move slowly, that things outside of Altoona also move slowly.</description>

I don&amp;#8217;t have proper backup and restore media or software. And a proper restore would restore my XP problem anyway.
The XP problem is that I can no longer install anything. When I try, I get a message like &amp;#8220;Setup failed to launch installation engine: The RPC server is unavailable.</description>

I was taking my dad on a tour of Altoona. We went to Lowes and Advance Auto, but also to the Wopsy Trail and the Horseshoe Curve.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m trying the bk lifestyle today. It&amp;#8217;s been pretty nice, but I&amp;#8217;ve found it a bit distracting. The grandkids are next door. It was somebody&amp;#8217;s birthday. There was lots of running around and swimming, etc.
I guess I should explain what I mean by the bk lifestyle. My friend bk is doing editing work for the Ludwig von Mises Institute. He does this predominately on his powerbook. When he&amp;#8217;s in Charlottesville, which he is this month, he spends most of his time doing his computing on his back deck.</description>

All of the CSS stuff that I&amp;#8217;ve done has still required that the things I want designed to have special s or s or whatever.</description>

The electrician has come and gone. And while he&amp;#8217;ll be back, it should be just to put a space-saving breaker in my breaker box to split out the circuit that feeds the computer UPS. And so, we&amp;#8217;re taken care of. In the two bedrooms upstairs, we have 2 data ports, one phone and one cable TV. We have 3 data and 1 cable in the den (that reminds me, I should go ahead and pre-order my Xbox 360), 2 data in the living room, one in the entry hallway for the wireless access point, and each of us has 3 data lines and one phone line for our desks in our basement office space.</description>

      <description>Before we moved in, I had called a couple of electricians for estimates &amp;#8212; I want to run data wiring (and phone and cable) to many of the rooms. Said electricians came by the house, eventually, one called me back and gave me a price and a schedule. It seemed pretty reasonable, though later than I wanted. I&amp;#8217;d assumed they could have it done before we moved in. Oh well.</description>

Chocolate Milk is what had been on the walls in the entry-way, living room and dining room in our new house. I think I described it as Salmon in an earlier post. It still seems a little too pink to be Chocolate Milk, but it is probably a little too brown to be Salmon.</description>

      <description>As I think I mentioned in the Life More Extraordinary post, we declined to (try) to learn the gender of our upcoming offspring. I&amp;#8217;m also pretty sure that Carolyn read that generally, men prefer to have boys. 
Not me. I hope she&amp;#8217;s a girl. That said, if she decides she wants to be a boy, that&amp;#8217;s fine too. I&amp;#8217;ll do my best to teach my child cross-gender skills. She will learn to fix toilets and ride motorcycles.</description>

      <description>Well, one it, at least. We&amp;#8217;ve closed. We have the house. It was, all things considered really easy. We met the realtor at her office and she drove us down to the title company where the closing was. We had quite a crowd there at the beginning. The seller, her daughter, and her realtor. The bank representative, the two of us with our realtor and the closing agent. After the first few batches of papers were signed, it thinned out a bit as the seller left.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s not that I&amp;#8217;ve meant not to blog. For about the first week or so of my blog absence, we were traveling. First to Philadelphia. There we met up with Ca&amp;#8217;s parents and went up to NYC to celebrate the engagement of Carolyn&amp;#8217;s brother John to his girlfriend Rika. Then out to Champaign, IL where we got a brief driving tour of the campus by my uncle Cam who&amp;#8217;s undergrad and law degrees both came from there.</description>

      <description>On our way out the door this morning to get an ultrasound and have a prenatal appointment we got a phone call. The call was the OB/GYN canceling our prenatal appointment. Some other woman had the audacity to go into labor and take our midwife away during OUR appointment time. The nerve of some people, I tell you!
We did, however, still have the ultrasound appointment. It&amp;#8217;s a little bit early (19 weeks instead of ~21-22 weeks) because we declined the triple screen, and because of our impending travel.</description>

      <description>I received an email recently from a &amp;#8220;long lost&amp;#8221; almost-relative, Rob. He had proposed marriage to my aunt Donna. She only declined because she was dying of Cystic Fibrosis and didn&amp;#8217;t want to saddle him with that. My aunt is now long dead, as is Rob&amp;#8217;s second (well, OK, FIRST) wife (also of CF). He&amp;#8217;s recently remarried and he and his new wife bought a house. He mentioned in his email that they had 9 particular things that they&amp;#8217;d wanted in a house, and this house had them all and then some.</description>

      <description>I read an interesting article that my mom sent me. She sent me the paper copy from the AARP bulletin that she (apparently) receives. The gist of the article (authored by Swarthmore professor Barry Schwartz) is that the free market is good at giving consumers choices, but an abundance of choices can cause decision paralysis and dissatisfaction. These are primarily afflictions suffered by &amp;#8220;maximizers&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; people who&amp;#8217;s goal in decision-making is to get &amp;#8220;the best&amp;#8221; as opposed to &amp;#8220;satisficers&amp;#8221; who&amp;#8217;s goal is to be satisfied.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m going to tempt fate again. Carolyn (wisely) suggested &amp;#8220;Why don&amp;#8217;t you write it offline first?&amp;#8221; And that really was a good suggestion. Only, I like to tempt fate &amp;#8212; at least with small things that don&amp;#8217;t really matter. And while I&amp;#8217;d like to tell you about my motorcycling, It&amp;#8217;s hardly really important. So, here I am again; in the blogger window, writing about motorcycling.

      <description>The onslaught of spam bounces continues. After a little further exploration, and discussions with the folks on the chuug list, we&amp;#8217;ve determined that a spammer is using randomstring@accapehart.com as the &amp;#8220;From:&amp;#8221; address for spam that he/she is sending out. As a result, for every message that is not successfully sent, I get a bounce back from the friendly MTA saying that they couldn&amp;#8217;t deliver the message I was trying to send.</description>

      <description>Joe, the author of Dadblog &amp;#8212; one of the 2 blogs that I read where I don&amp;#8217;t know the author &amp;#8212; wrote to me today. Apparently, he was looking through his web log analysis software, and saw a referrer he didn&amp;#8217;t recognize (my blog). He checked me out and correctly deduced that we have a common friend in Clinton.
This spurred me to check my own logs. 
Almost everything was as I expected but for 2 things:</description>

      <description>The universe doesn&amp;#8217;t want me to tell you about my motorcycling. Now, for the second time, I&amp;#8217;ve started a post about my history motorcycling only to have the process fail unrecoverably.
The first time, submitting the completed post to Blogger, I got a server error page. Pressing the back button, I was faced with an empty page.
This time, I was looking for a web image of a Suzuki GS 550 ES (the first bike I bought), and clicking back in a separate tab caused FIREFOX on LINUX to just disappear.</description>

There is a designer in the Neon Guild1who is proposing to do a site for a client. The designer talked to Jack about doing internationalization for the client. Jack talked to me. I experimented with it (here) to make sure I knew what I&amp;#8217;d do.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s been a little slow the last few days. Monday night I helped Carolyn arrange her desk in her new office. She switched buildings because they are going to expand the library to use both floors &amp;#8212; including the one her office was in. Her new office is smaller than most of the rest, but has a double-expanse of window to make up for it. It&amp;#8217;s certainly a step up from the closet they had her in before!</description>

      <description>Yeah. It&amp;#8217;s the Sunday before the last week of the &amp;#8220;spring&amp;#8221; semester, and it&amp;#8217;s snowing. SNOWING! To be fair, it&amp;#8217;s a light, blustery snow that&amp;#8217;s not sticking to anything. But, c&amp;#8217;mon already. We were having a BEAUTIFUL spring.
In Charlottesville, it seemed like there was always a week or so every winter in which it was balmy and beautiful. Don&amp;#8217;t tell me that in Altoona we&amp;#8217;ll get a week or so every summer in which it&amp;#8217;s DARK AND SNOWY!</description>

      <description>So, I started playing around more with Ruby on Rails (RoR) recently. I&amp;#8217;m seriously impressed. There&amp;#8217;s an excellent tutorial available that walks you through making a todo list application via rails.
I&amp;#8217;ve done a fair amount of CGI programming in Python. And a good bit of Java servlet application programming. Neither feels as natural as RoR. I feel like once I actually have a better handle on both the Ruby language itself, and the Rails framework, I&amp;#8217;ll be able to pump out database-supported web applications quickly and with a minimum of fuss.</description>

Just now, I had a long, long talk about bicycling. I took a quick break to check email before posting because I wanted to give a moment to see if I really wanted to be that incendiary.</description>

      <description>(with apologies to Wallace &amp;amp; Gromit for the title.)
Today was my birthday, though I pretty much used the whole weekend to celebrate.
Yesterday, I borrowed a motorcycle from a friend of a friend (how cool is that!?!) and went for a motorcycle ride with about 8 others in a motley collection of motorcycles (only 2 were even from the same manufacturer!). We headed south from Altoona along twisty back roads and found ourselves (with a little bit of searching) at the Road Kill Caf&amp;eacute;.</description>

I had figured it was just another random network outage granted us by our benevolent cable company. I figured they were aware of it and working on it. But as it stretched on toward 24 hours, I thought I should at least call and check on it with them. I was surprised and worried when they said &amp;#8220;No, no known problems in that area.</description>

But the way I found that guy&amp;#8217;s camtoons was from his page where he had linked to a picture of his motorcycle. You see, I&amp;#8217;ve been lusting after a new motorcycle since&amp;#8230; well, pretty much since I sold my previous motorcycle in the move to Altoona.</description>

It&amp;#8217;s off, or inaccessible, or I&amp;#8217;ve got to pair it again, or&amp;#8230; it&amp;#8217;s always something. And given the choice between that, and some cold, hard cash in my paypal account&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;m going for the dough.
So, treat yourself to a Bluetooth headset.</description>

Seeing that, I thought that gay pride was under-represented on my web page. I was looking for a rainbow icon, and a reasonable place to link it to when I came across the &amp;#8220;Homo Depot&amp;#8221;. Just the name cracked me up and they have lots of interesting fridge magnets, buttons etc.</description>

I went for my first &amp;#8220;real&amp;#8221; bike ride of the season today (on the road bike, not the bike in the picture). It was good to get out. I went through town, out (and up!</description>

      <description>We were in Florida for a conference of Carolyn&amp;#8217;s last week. She gave what I thought was a kick-ass close reading of a French novel I&amp;#8217;d never heard of. Unfortunately, the audience was the same size as the panel itself (not including the moderator!)
It was sunny and in the 80&amp;#8217;s. I went walking along a nice, paved rail-trail. I soo wish I&amp;#8217;d thought to bring my roller blades. We went to Cedar Key.</description>

      <description>Now that that bit of info (Carolyn is pregnant) is out there, I can talk about it. I was playing with gizoogle because I was updating my home page to include searches. Gizoogle&amp;#8217;s just another dialectizer, but more closely coupled to Google&amp;#8217;s searching.
While adding Gizoogle, I tested it with the phrase &amp;#8220;something fun&amp;#8221; and came across http://www.kneebouncers.com. I&amp;#8217;m (mildly) embarrassed to say how much fun I had there. I imagined my child on my lap slapping at the keyboard and watching the guitar play, or the drums.</description>

      <description>Carolyn and I have news that we&amp;#8217;ve been starting to share. What&amp;#8217;s most interesting about this process is people&amp;#8217;s reactions to it seem very personal, and certainly all over the map.
The news is that we&amp;#8217;re pregnant. Well, Carolyn&amp;#8217;s pregnant. I&amp;#8217;m just cranky, gaining weight and nauseated (nauseating?).
The reactions, as I&amp;#8217;ve mentioned, have been all over the map. As an artifact of who was home when, we told Carolyn&amp;#8217;s parents first.</description>

      <description>Well, after much back and forth, we have an agreement to buy the house. It should be a happy occasion, and truthfully, it mostly is. But I&amp;#8217;m still a bit pissy about $250.00. That&amp;#8217;s right. We&amp;#8217;ve come to an agreement on approximately $150,000, and I&amp;#8217;m pissy about $250.00. Let me break it down for you.
First, the seller is an old lady. A recent widow who&amp;#8217;s lived in that house since 1973.</description>

      <description>Well, as I said we would, we made an offer on the house &amp;#8212; 512 28th Ave today. And we received a counter offer this evening.
The asking price was $155K. We offered $145K, and asked for a late closing date (so we don&amp;#8217;t have to pay a rent and mortgage the same month), and every appliance in the place (even the snowblower!). We got a counter offer &amp;#8212; everything but the snow blower, $149,500, but an extra $3000 in that goes into escrow with her agent (we already included $1000 in what my mom called &amp;#8220;ernest money&amp;#8221; to show that we&amp;#8217;re serious about the offer).</description>

      <description>We re-visited house #1 today &amp;#8212; 512 28th Ave (I took another huge batch of pictures this trip). We&amp;#8217;re going to make an offer tomorrow. I&amp;#8217;m scared. I don&amp;#8217;t remember being this scared about Gateway circle, but I don&amp;#8217;t remember emotions much anyway. I&amp;#8217;m not exactly sure why I&amp;#8217;m scared. I guess it&amp;#8217;s just financial. I&amp;#8217;m worried about failing to make payments, or having the C&amp;#8217;ville house go un-rented and having to pay two mortgages when it feels like we&amp;#8217;re stretched paying just our rent right now.</description>

      <description>Well, we finally engaged a real estate agent. We met with her (and an associated mortgage person) on Thursday, and put together a list of houses to see which we did, today.
We saw a total of 5. Of those five, it breaks down like this:
#1 Nice, everything we need, more on it later.
#2 Funky. Old. Sideways-looking. Awesome neighborhood. Awesome hardwood floors. Semi-renovated. Too expensive. Sucky closets. Only heat in basement was wood stove.</description>

      <description>I got two surprises in my gas bill today. The first really pisses me off. The second confuses me. The first is that they &amp;#8220;estimated&amp;#8221; my gas usage. Though if they used anything as advanced as mathematics in estimating my gas usage, it would surprise me. Somehow, they thought that during the shortest (and albeit coldest) month of the year, I would manage to use 3.7 TIMES my average monthly usage; That the gas I used in February would some how be approximately half of ALL of the gas that I used from July up until February.</description>

      <description>I really didn&amp;#8217;t expect this. We were going to a few open houses. That was all. We were going to see a few places to get a feel for the neighborhoods as well as what our money would buy. Who knows, maybe even find that exact gem of a house we are looking for.
We saw a large and rambly 4 bedroom rancher from the 50&amp;#8217;s. The only significant updates since then were some new appliances (the old ones were still in the garage) and a new roof.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;#8217;t know why I take these quizzes really. Does it matter to me to know who my inner rock star is? Or how well I stack up against my peers in my successful distinction between there, they&amp;#8217;re and their? Still, I saw a quiz that asked which (witch? 😉 religion was right for me, and I took it.
I am amused to announce that I&amp;#8217;m a Satanist. I wonder if there&amp;#8217;s a checkbox for that on PSU&amp;#8217;s equal opportunity employment form somewhere.</description>

      <description>We went to visit the inlaws over spring break. Well, my inlaws; her parents. It was nice. The Philadelphia area is different from Altoona. Plus, they take us out to nice dinners!
One of the many family jokes or elements of folklore, or what have you, is my penchant for barber shops. Barber shops are great. They&amp;#8217;re almost always a source of local color, and I don&amp;#8217;t understand paying $18 for someone at a &amp;#8220;salon&amp;#8221; to cut my hair when I can get it cut for almost half the price by someone with probably twice the experience.</description>

      <description>Every now and again, I look through my awstats for my web logs. It was really fascinating when I first set it up. Now, I look at it maybe once a week. Soon, I&amp;#8217;m sure it&amp;#8217;ll dwindle to once a month. Mostly, I get a kick out what people were searching for when they wind up on my pages.
Usually, it&amp;#8217;s stuff that makes sense. My flying info was pretty useful and interesting when I put it up, and I typed up the checklist that the flight school gave me for the Cessna 152 I was flying.</description>

      <description>Well, the &amp;#8220;70&amp;#8217;s palace&amp;#8221; that I talked about here has been sold. And no, not to us. I went for a bike ride yesterday and rode by the house. The for sale signs were gone, and there was a pickup in the drive way and stuff in the garage.
On that same bike ride, however, I went past a house that I&amp;#8217;d ridden past in the fall. In the fall, it was a FSBO, that when I finally got around to showing to Carolyn, the for sale sign was already gone.</description>

      <description>It should be a surprise to no one given my &amp;#8220;north wing&amp;#8221; political views that I&amp;#8217;m not a big fan of taxes. I just don&amp;#8217;t get the justification for the government to take approximately a third of my income. It certainly didn&amp;#8217;t make my work a third easier. And that&amp;#8217;s just income taxes. Every time I buy something, there&amp;#8217;s sales tax. Every time I trade in the stock market, there&amp;#8217;s capital gains taxes.</description>

Well, that was frustrating. After my friend was cracked, I decided that it would be smart to keep my web content in a revision control system. That way, when some malicious cracker replaced all of my index files with self-congratulatory tripe, all I&amp;#8217;d really need to do would be to restore from the repository.</description>

      <description>Getting Warmed Up I&amp;#8217;ve had a rant brewing on this for over a year now. Every time I try to write something on it, I get angry. I spew. While cathartic, it rarely makes for good reading. I&amp;#8217;m going to try again. And I&amp;#8217;m going to try to keep this coherent. Whether I succeed is yet to be determined.
I am provoked by a recent Reuters news piece which can be read from Wired News here.</description>

      <description>I was afraid of this, when I started. Creativity drought. Some of the things I have to say, simply can&amp;#8217;t be said yet. Others seem too mundane to say. Still more might be appropriate for this forum but feel like they&amp;#8217;ve arrived just so that I have something to say here.
I will doubtless have some stories next week though. This weekend will be interesting. I&amp;#8217;m going down to Richmond to spend some time with my dad for his birthday.</description>

Unfortunately, it was. It looked just like I had intended it to look. It may be clear at this point, that though I&amp;#8217;ve spent just about all of my adult life in front of a computer, a web designer I am not.</description>

      <description>According to my recollection of Straczynski&amp;#8217;s commentary around Babylon 5 or at least as much as I heard before muting it because he started dishing out spoilers, those were the two main questions of Bab5: Who are you? and What do you want?
Personally, I don&amp;#8217;t think &amp;#8220;Who are you?&amp;#8221; is a very interesting question, because I think the answer is too complex to be interesting or useful. I don&amp;#8217;t think we (or at least I) have a good map for that territory.</description>

I&amp;#8217;d already been introduced to my Central PA neighbor Jay Hosler&amp;#8216;s work as well as the darwin collaboration that the story refers to by a comic book buddy and communications professor (all wrapped up in the same dude) on a bike ride together. I already knew that comics could have a profound impact on our thinking both culturally and individually.</description>

      <description>Although it feels a little early for it given our lease constraints, we started home shopping in Altoona today in a slightly more serious way. Today, we visted the first house that we actually went inside. We took several pictures [link since removed since we didn&amp;#8217;t buy this house -ed] but even as many as we took, I still want to have taken more.
House summary: Built in 1983, it&amp;#8217;s a 3 bedroom, 3 bath home with oversized 2 car garage on a 100&amp;#8217;x120&amp;#8242; lot on the corner of Lloyd St and E.</description>

      <description>Already, I&amp;#8217;m glad I entered the Google AdSense program. I&amp;#8217;ve been crawled by googlebot a fair amount recently, but apparently, they still don&amp;#8217;t have enough info to put together real ads for my page(s). Instead, I can either run a background color (which I had been doing) or public service announcements for which I don&amp;#8217;t get paid. As you can see, as of this writing at least, I&amp;#8217;m now doing the latter.</description>

      <description>This morning, I was feeling pretty good about myself. I was reviewing a Java Web Services Tutorial and it was making sense. I tried the examples, and with a little bit of classpath fudging, I got them to work. I tried a quote generator I found on xmethods.com and got it to work. I was impressed with myself. Then I looked through the &amp;#8220;additional resources&amp;#8221; section at the end and found my way to a book on XML-RPC.</description>

      <description>On a lighter note, I applied for Google AdSense ads today for the blog. I have no idea if they&amp;#8217;ll take it, and I&amp;#8217;m sure I don&amp;#8217;t have the readership to actually generate enough money to care about. But, I thought I&amp;#8217;d try it.
I mention this partly because I think it&amp;#8217;s noteworthy. But what cracked me up was when I found the online version of the Wired print article concerning the postal monopoly for my previous blog entry, I saw that the wired article also had Google AdSense ads.</description>

A school district my parents had moved into three years earlier &amp;#8211; and shortly before their divorce &amp;#8212; specifically so that I could go to the good county schools instead of the crappy city schools. All, in all, it was not bad. I got the fancy education, but I was not as insulated in my upper-crust world as other school-mates of mine.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m not exactly sure when I first put up the picture of me bicycling on my home page, and titled the page &amp;#8220;The (hopefully quite temporary) home page for AC Capehart&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; probably some time around 1999, maybe 2000. When did I do the MS 150? I bought the bike I&amp;#8217;m pictured on partly for that ride. Anyway, somewhere on the order of 5-6 years ago. I intended it to be a placeholder.</description>

      <description>I suppose that one never really knows what one&amp;#8217;s impact on the world will be.
In anticipation of heightened traffic as bk&amp;#8217;s blog readers were notified of the existence of my blog, I installed awstats. I had done that a few machines ago, but at the time doing even a basic config for a web server was a PITA. Or, at least I thought it was then. Now, it&amp;#8217;s pretty trivial, and I&amp;#8217;ve lumped all my *accapehart.</description>

      <description>I made a promise that I regret. I told bk that if I posted two more blog entries in the coming 7 days that he could announce my (unread) blog on his (somewhat more read) blog. I regret this not because I fear my voice being heard by the unwashed masses &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s been too long since my shower anyway &amp;#8212; no, I regret it because it&amp;#8217;s got me thinking about number and size of blog content in a way that feels inappropriate to the spirit of blogging.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m writing this after the fact (by a couple of days) instead of as it was intended (by a couple of hours). Still interesting (to me).
I&amp;#8217;m on a vacation of sorts, in Southern Maryland, or SOMD as I&amp;#8217;ve taken to calling it1. I decided not to bring my laptop because I had a certain confidence there would be no Internet connectivity where we were staying. My cell phone broke, so today, I&amp;#8217;m really disconnected.</description>

      <description>Today I was driving around south-east Baltimore along some busy-ish highway (695?) (97?) when the two lanes of traffic I was in went down to one due to construction. The signs said that the right lane was closed in 1&amp;frasl;2 mile, merge left. I was already in the left lane, so in good shape. As other drivers heeded the warning and worked their way left, the left lane became more crowded and slower.</description>

      <description>For those that don&amp;#8217;t know, Google&amp;#8217;s now offering a webmail service. The &amp;#8220;advantage&amp;#8221; to google&amp;#8217;s mail is that you get a gig of storage, and you get google&amp;#8217;s search interface to your stuff. The idea being &amp;#8212; why bother to trash stuff or sort/organize it. Just archive it all and search for what you need. Maybe that&amp;#8217;ll work. I dunno.
But, since &amp;#8220;gmail&amp;#8221; is still in &amp;#8220;beta&amp;#8221;, it&amp;#8217;s by invitation only.</description>

      <description>I had written something like this earlier, but it disappeared into the ether with a 500 Error from blogger.com. What follows is a re-creation, doubtless somewhat more organized, but less impassioned than the original.)
I don&amp;#8217;t like folding laundry. And I don&amp;#8217;t understand folding proteins. But, thanks to Folding@Home I&amp;#8217;m now doing my part toward their goal to understand protein folding, protein aggregation, and related diseases. But, it&amp;#8217;s not the hidden-bio-geek in me that&amp;#8217;s enjoying this.</description>

      <description>OK, I kinda meant to have complained, or at least thought (in the blog) about money, job, life etc. But that just hasn&amp;#8217;t come up as strongly as it could have in the past few days. I&amp;#8217;m sure one will come soon though.
But today I want to rant. I guess this is kind of a rant about job because if I were in an office with other geeks, especially other linux admin/java geeks, I might just get answers to my problems instead of having to google them (with limited success.</description>

      <description>I just finished a book by Norma Jean Almodovar entitled Cop to Call Girl describing aspects of her two careers &amp;#8212; first as a traffic cop with the LAPD and subsequently as a call girl. And, to a lesser extent her activism concerning the decriminalization of consensual sex laws. I borrowed it from bk partly because I&amp;#8217;m moderately fascinated by sex work and those that do it and partly because it did seem like an unusual transition.</description>

      <description>OK, not really much hope &amp;#8212; hope and fear being opposite sides of the same coin. I guess I do fear that I will not continue to blog. I&amp;#8217;ve tried journaling several times in my life, without much success. Fortunately, as there is not much hope, there is also not much fear. If I don&amp;#8217;t continue to blog, then I&amp;#8217;m exactly as out of touch with people as I already am.</description>

      <description>Day 12
The moulding went down pretty quickly, the carpet edges were a bit more trouble, but I decided to use what we had rather than wait for stuff that fit better. I still have clean up to do, but I&amp;#8217;m done. bk helped me move the sleeper sofa and the dining room table back in. I&amp;#8217;m done. I&amp;#8217;ve gotta clean up, but I&amp;#8217;m done. I can&amp;#8217;t believe it. And what&amp;#8217;s more, I think it looks nice.</description>

      <description>Day 11:
As predicted, I needed to get up early to return the various rentals. So, I got up at 7:00 (after setting the alarm for 6:30) and made it to United Rentals out Avon Extd. with 10 minutes to spare. I dropped off the floor machine and told them what a mess I&amp;#8217;d left the brush in. They thanked me for my honesty and said &amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t worry about it.&amp;#8221; I was thrilled.</description>

      <description>Day 10. The waxing day.
So today is the day I most dreaded. Much of this process was new and scary to me, but for most of it I had some sense of what I should do. Some guide, some hint of the right thing to do. Well, I guess I had a hint about the waxing, but much less than any other part. The video wasn&amp;#8217;t that helpful, and the voiceover guy in the video turned out to have been reading almost exactly word for word the instructions on the wax can.</description>

      <description>Day 9. Saturday. I slept in &amp;#8217;til 9:30. I was hoping to clean and wax today. So, I went to United Rental looking for the floor machine and brushes I needed. I figured I&amp;#8217;d go ahead and get a wet/dry vac for the cleaning too. They didn&amp;#8217;t know much about the conststancy or material about the brushes they had, so I took them all. And, they didn&amp;#8217;t have a wet/dry vac.</description>

      <description>Day 8
Again, up at 8:30 and after a quick balance bar for breakfast I&amp;#8217;m at the floor again. This time, I do a little clean up. Our trash piles had been piling up, and I&amp;#8217;d left stuff in a bit of a state the previous evening having been so tired.
I call up Joe and he comes over. He does a general mopping with TSP while I scrub extra hard in the cat corners.</description>

      <description>Day 7.
I got up about 8:30 and was working on the floor in a little over half an hour. Al had called last night in response to my query about the sander. He said it was probably just the bushings and would be an easy repair. Continue to work with it and when it stopped working, take and get it fixed. It probably worked for a good 10 minutes before it gave up the ghost.</description>

      <description>Again up around 9:30. Bob was still here. I managed to have perfect timing though. I went downstairs when he was in the shower, and then went to food lion for orange juice (we were out). As I was coming back to Gateway Circle, I saw Bob pulling into the McDonalds for breakfast. So, again a quick breakfast and back to the floor. This time, I did a more systematic sanding slowly back and forth across the entire section of floor.</description>

      <description>Day 5.
I arose rather late (9:30?) and came downstairs to find Al doing Yoga in our kitchen. He was doing the &amp;#8220;Breath of Joy&amp;#8221; After a small breakfast, we started in with the sanding. Al had brought a rotary sander (kind of like a power drill) and a belt sander. We were sanding around the edges where the grinder just couldn&amp;#8217;t get. It was slow going. VERY slow going. The image that came to mind was cleaning the statue of liberty with a toothbrush.</description>

      <description>Day 4. I thought of all sorts of ways to begin this entry. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s weird cutting lines into your floor with a circular saw.&amp;#8221; Or &amp;#8220;Man, concrete dust is something else. It really does get everywhere!&amp;#8221; Or &amp;#8220;I was right, scoring the floor did help me feel like the project is really progressing.&amp;#8221; And they are all true to at least some degree. So, here&amp;#8217;s the deal.
I got up at 6:45 AM today to go return the grinder to sunbelt rentals.</description>

      <description>Santa (Al) comes monday to help. I&amp;#8217;m pleased and relieved. But I need to get up and return the scraper thing before 9:00 AM Monday, and need to pick up more supplies both there and at Lowes. This is going to be a long project. It feels like it&amp;#8217;s already been a long project. I&amp;#8217;m glad I took a bit of a break this evening to play with CJ and watch eXistenZ (a weird &amp;#8220;majestic&amp;#8221; type movie).</description>

      <description>Eve and Tom just left. And this morning/afternoon, we laid out the scoring pattern. There are a couple of tricky spots, but I think it will be pretty straightforward. Joe indicated he might come by this weekend and see what it looks like. If Monday at noon (or shortly after) comes and goes and I&amp;#8217;ve not heard from him, I&amp;#8217;m going to give him a call. But either way, I&amp;#8217;m going to find out if he&amp;#8217;d be willing to come score after work Monday or Tuesday.</description>

      <description>Day 2. (AC, Eve &amp;amp; Tom with moving help from bk and CJ) Well, we just completed day 2. It feels like we&amp;#8217;ve made a lot of progress, but what remains is still fairly daunting. Today, we finished moving the remainder of the furniture to storage, and started ripping up the carpet. The carpet itself came up quite easily. The padding underneath was glued down around the edges, and the carpet was pressed into tackboard around the edges.</description>

      <description>The Story:
Our cat is (or at least was) insecure. Or maybe he had a bladder infection. Or maybe he just didn&amp;#8217;t like us. Whatever the reason, he peed/marked just about every corner in the living room and dining room (as well as a few in the den). We tried all sorts of cleaners and techniques, nothing seemed to work, at lest not well enough to keep him from re-soiling the areas.</description>

      <description>This is AC Capehart&amp;rsquo;s home on the web. But as he&amp;rsquo;s a bit itinerant right now, it&amp;rsquo;s actually an odd collection of historical posts of very little interest to anyone not actively stalking him.</description>
